            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Induſtrious and Judicious Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, doth here preſent thee with two diſtinct Tractates concerning the Chriſtian Sabbath, or Lords Day: In the former, the Divine Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it is cleerly proved; In the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the time of its beginning is particularly determined. In the former, the erronious conſcience, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies the morality of the fourth Commandement, is ſtrongly convinced: In the latter, the ſcrupulous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, which doubts of the time when the Sabbath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, is fully ſatisfied.</p>
            <p>In both, the ſerious Reader will find great profit and delight; The whole Diſcourſe being illaborate and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous, wherein beſides the main points intended in it, divers other matters of important Cognizance are oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally decided, and diſcuſſed, and many obſcure Scriptures are excellently explained according to the genuine ſenſe thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:167973:3"/>And this learned Diſcourſe hath its birth in a very ſeaſonable time, in reſpect of that wofull defection and Apoſtacy that is among us, as from the truth and wayes of God in general, ſo in a ſpecial manner from the Religious eſteem and obſervation of the Lords day.</p>
            <p>For never ſince the light of the bleſſed and glorious Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt ſhined upon this our <hi>Goſhen,</hi> was the Sabbath Day ſo wickedly neglected and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaned by the generality of people, and the Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution thereof ſo ſhamefully denyed, and decried by many pretenders to Religion, as it is at this day.</p>
            <p>And therefore (Good Reader) we heartily commend this neceſſary and uſefull work to thy diligent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſal, and thy ſelf, and thy humble and ſincere in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries after Truth, unto the guidance and bleſsing of the God of all Truth.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>MAny do affirm that the Sabbath was ordained in the time of</hi> Adams <hi>Innocency: But I ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to prove that it was not ordained till after</hi> Adams <hi>Fall and Recovery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this I ſhall endeavour to make evident by proving theſe two points.</p>
            <p>
               <list>
                  <item>I <hi>That</hi> Adam <hi>diſobeyed and fell in the ſame ſixth day in which he was created and made.</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>Proving, by five Reaſons, that <hi>Adam</hi> Fell in the day of his Creation.</p>

                  <hi>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Oſes</hi> doth manifeſtly declare that <hi>Adam</hi> fell in the day of his Creation, becauſe he joyneth<note place="margin">Becauſe <hi>Moſes</hi> joyneth <hi>Adams</hi> creation, triall, judgement, &amp; promiſe, to the ſame day.</note> the ſtory of his Temptation and Fall in Chapter 3. cloſe to his Creation, and ſeating in Paradiſe, in Chapter 2. without mentioning of any other matter to come between.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>Here it may be objected, that Moſes doth firſt ſet down the ſtory of</hi> Adams <hi>creation, in</hi> Gen. 1. <hi>and then he
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:167973:10"/>
doth ſet down the Inſtitution of the Sabbath in the beginning of</hi> Gen. 2. 2, 3. <hi>which is in order of time before the ſtory of</hi> Adams <hi>Temptation and Fall, in</hi> Chap. 3.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Though <hi>Moſes</hi> doth place the Inſtitution of the Sabbath, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> before the ſtory of <hi>Adams</hi> fall; yet it is evident that he doth place it there onely by the figure <hi>Hyſteron Proteron</hi> (not becauſe he had done with the ſtory of the Sixth day in the firſt Chapter, but becauſe that ſtory being large) he would firſt in a brief ſort lay down the ſtory of all the ſeven dayes of the week together, which he doth from the beginning of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſis</hi> to the end of the third verſe of the ſecond Chapter, and then he returns again to ſpeak of the ſtory of the ſixth day more at large, and makes a larger Narration of the Creation, and Fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> from the ſeventh verſe of the ſecond Chapter, to the end of the third Chapter, with variety of inlargements more than was in the firſt Chapter; for repetitions have uſually many new additions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo in true Chronology, and in the order of ſtory, the Inſtitution of the Sabbath in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 2, 3. muſt be placed at the end of <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. as I have after diſcuſſed the matter in that Text.</p>
               <p>And the method of <hi>Moſes</hi> in this large ſtory of the ſixth day, is very obſervable, and lyes thus.</p>
               <p n="1">1 He ſheweth the Matter and Form of <hi>Adams</hi> Creation, in Chap. 2. verſ. 7. but this he had omitted in Chap. 1.</p>
               <p n="2">2 He ſheweth <hi>Adams</hi> Lordſhip over the creatures, for God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded all the beaſts of the field, and all the fowls of the air, to preſent themſelves before <hi>Adam</hi> as their Lord, that he might name them with names defining their nature, and that they might wait upon him as their Lord and Maſter into Paradiſe, verſ. 19, 20. but in a part of his Lordſhip he was reſtrained, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God did prohibit him the tree of knowledge of good and evill.</p>
               <p n="3">3 He ſhews the matter and manner of the Womans creation, of <hi>Adams</hi> Rib, verſ. 18. which he had omitted in Chap. 1. and it is placed in Chap. 2. verſ. 18. by the figure <hi>Hyſteron Proteron,</hi> becauſe there was not to be found among all the other creatures that were brought before <hi>Adam,</hi> a meet helper for <hi>Adam,</hi> verſ. 20. ſhe was the laſt ſort of all the viſible creatures of this world.</p>
               <p n="4">4 God brings the woman to the man, and joyns them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in Mariage, as a meet helper for him, verſ. 22. This was omitted in Chap. 1.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:167973:10"/>5 He ſhews that the place of their creation was without the borders of Paradiſe, verſ. 8. 15. compared with Chap. 3. 23.</p>
               <p n="6">6 He deſcribes the ſituation of that pleaſant Garden of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe, which God made for the place of their habitation, as an addition to their happy condition by creation, verſ. 8. &amp;c. but this is to be marked, that <hi>Moſes</hi> doth by the figure <hi>Hyſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ron Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teron,</hi> place their aboad in Paradiſe, verſ. 8. &amp;c. before the creation of the woman; which figure he uſeth very often in this Chapter, and in the third Chapter.</p>
               <p n="7">7 He ſhews the ſpecial uſe of two Trees above the reſt, by ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial names, verſ. 9.</p>
               <p n="8">8 He ſhews that God gave <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> a twofold command concerning theſe two Trees: The firſt was a poſitive command, ſaying unto them in the ſingular number (becauſe of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage-union) Of every Tree of the Garden thou mayeſt eat, but of that Tree which doth moſt concern the good of thy preſent condition (I have named the Tree of life) therefore in the firſt place eat of the Tree of life, and thou ſhalt live for ever, for by the name of it, God did not onely ſhew the uſe of it, but alſo he ſhewed them their duty concerning it, verſe 9. compared with Chapter 3. 22. Secondly, By way of prohibition and commina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, God commanded them ſaying, <hi>Eat not of the Tree of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of good and evill, for in the day thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt ſurely dye the death,</hi> Gen. 2. 17.</p>
               <p n="9">9 Unto all theſe particulars in this order connexed together, <hi>Moſes</hi> doth immediately proceed to ſpeak of <hi>Adams</hi> temptation by the Serpent, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 1. and of his Fall, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 6. And thus after this ſort, <hi>Moſes</hi> doth adjoyn <hi>Adams</hi> fall faſt to his Creation, and ſeating in Paradiſe, without making mention of any other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that came between.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This Reaſon is further ſtrengthned by the conſent of ſundry good Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors both ancient and latter.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaith in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 6. It may be gathered by the Narration of <hi>Moſes,</hi> That <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> did not long keep their Dignity which they had received, for as ſoon as he had but ſaid they were made, making no mention of any other matter, he paſſeth to ſhew the Fall.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Ainſworth</hi> alſo obſerveth in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 1. That mans fall and miſery is immediately joyned to his creation, and ſeating in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:167973:11"/>Mr. <hi>Broughton</hi> alſo obſerveth (in his <hi>Sinai</hi>-ſight <hi>Tab.</hi> 1.) That <hi>Moſes</hi> joyneth mans Creation, Triall, Judgement, and Promiſe, to the ſame day before the woman was called <hi>Eve.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>M. <hi>Broughton</hi> alſo in his ſhewing of corruptions in Religion <hi>p.</hi> 85. ſaith, The firſt day, in which <hi>Adam</hi> was made, he diſobeyed, as all may ſee by the continued narration for <hi>Eve,</hi> and for the Serpents Speech, and Temptation, and Judgement for Curſe upon all the Earth.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors alſo do generally hold that <hi>Adam</hi> fell on the day of his creation; Mr. <hi>Broughton</hi> ſaith, in Conſent of Scripture, that he never heard of any one of them that was of a contrary judgement, and Mr. <hi>Ainſworth</hi> ſaith in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. that the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors hold that nothing (in that Chapter) was done after the ſixth day of Creation, and ſaith <hi>Maymony, All our wiſe men do agree, that this whole matter</hi> (in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.) <hi>was done in the ſixth day.</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>Rabbi Nathan</hi> doth make the ſtory of the ſixth day remarkable, by joyning many things to the ſtory of that day in ſundry Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toricall expreſſions, ſaying thus, The ſame day that <hi>Adam</hi> was formed, the ſame day that he was created, the ſame day that his faſhion was faſhioned, the ſame day that his mould was made, the ſame day that his members were knit, the ſame day that his veines were opened, the ſame day that life was put into him, the ſame day that he ſtood firſt upon his feet, the ſame day that <hi>Eve</hi> was maried to him, the ſame day that he gave names, the ſame day that he entred into Paradiſe, the ſame day that God gave him the Commandement, the ſame day he diſobeyed, the ſame day he was driven out of Paradiſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Perkins</hi> on the Creed, touching the time of <hi>Adams</hi> Fall, ſaith, The received opinion in former ages hath been, that our firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents fell the ſame day in which they were created, and therefore <hi>Auguſtine</hi> writes, That they ſtood but ſix hours; and though we cannot determine the certain time, yet in all likelihood (ſaith he) it was very ſhort, for after that <hi>Moſes</hi> had ſet down the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of man, he preſently without the interpoſition of any thing elſe, comes immediately to the fall.</p>

                  <hi>Irenaeus Contra Haere.

Paſſion, which was the ſixth day of the Creation of the world when man was formed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> on <hi>Matth.</hi> ſaith, That <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> in the ſixth day of the firſt week, which was the very ſame day of their crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, were caſt out of Paradiſe.</p>
               <p>Divers other Divines both <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latines</hi> are concurrent in the ſame opinion, many of which are alſo cited by Mr. <hi>Brough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> in his Conſent of Scripture, where he citeth this as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſaying among them, <hi>That in one day</hi> Adam <hi>was formed, and deformed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſo conſequently from this Reaſon it follows, that the Sabbath was not inſtituted in the time of <hi>Adams</hi> Innocency, but after his Fall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſon 2. Adam</hi> fell the very firſt time that ever he eat any thing,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Adam</hi> fell in the day of his creation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he fell the very firſt time of his eating.</note> and therefore he fell on the day of his creation; for in reaſon he would not abſtain from eating longer than that day, ſeeing va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of meat was created ready for him to eat, and an appetite created to deſire food.</p>
               <p>And that he fell the very firſt time of eating, it is evident, Firſt, By the Devils Queſtion; and ſecondly, By the Womans An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</p>
               <p n="1">1 The Devil in the Serpent, demandeth this Queſtion of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, <hi>Hath God ſaid, Ye ſhall not eat of every tree of the Garden?</hi> Gen. 3. 1. mark how the Devils demand, by way of Query, is of a thing to come: And indeed the Devill had not deſerved the name of a ſubtil Serpent, if he had demanded whether that might be done, which had been done already.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The Womans Anſwer to the Serpents Queſtion runs ſtill of a thing to come: For the Woman ſaid to the Serpent in <hi>Gen. 3. 2. We may eat, or we ſhall eat</hi> (ſo the <hi>Hebrew</hi> is) <hi>of the fruit of the Trees of the Garden, except of the fruit of the Tree which is in the midſt of the Garden;</hi> intimating, ſaith Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> on the Creed, that as yet ſhe had not eaten when the Devil tempted her; and thus the Devills Queſtion, and the Womans Anſwer of a thing to come, do both imply, that as yet they had not taſted any part of the fruit of the Garden; and doubtleſſe <hi>Adam</hi> having variety of food ſet before him, and a created appetite to eat, he would not abſtain from eating longer than the day of his creation, ſeeing the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:167973:12"/>
pureſt nature craves daily food, as we may ſee by our Saviours hungring, and by all new-born creatures; neither was <hi>Adam</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated to faſt for want of food, for variety of food was ſet before him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and free liberty to eat thereof, verſ. 16. neither was <hi>Adams</hi> appetite hindred through any infirmity of nature, for as God had created variety of food for their eating, ſo doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he created a true naturall appetite in them to deſire food (at the firſt convenient opportunity) though their appetite was not irregular and painful to them as ours is to us.</p>
               <p>And doubtleſſe the devill was not ignorant that <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> had a true naturall appetite to deſire food, and therefore without any delay he fitted his temptation ſuitable to their natural ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, and the like crafty policie he uſed to our Saviour when he was an hungry, and becauſe there was no meat pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for him in a readineſſe as there was for <hi>Adam,</hi> he fitted his temptation thereafter, ſaying, <hi>If thou be the Son of God, make this ſtone bread,</hi> Mat. 4. So then it appears by this reaſon, that <hi>Adam</hi> would not forbear eating longer than the day of his creation; and it appears by the Devils Queſtion, and the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans Anſwer, that as yet they had eaten no fruit till they had eaten of the forbidden fruit, and therefore it follows, Firſt, That <hi>Adam</hi> fell in the day of his creation; And ſecondly, that the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath was not ordained in the time of Adams innocency but after his fall.<note place="margin">Becauſe <hi>Adam</hi> being created after God in wiſdom, would not in wiſdom have omi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Reaſon 3. Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> being created after the image of God in Wiſdom, had not deſerved the deſcription of being made wiſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gods Image, (if the devill had left them but one day to the freedome of their own will) if they had not made choice to eat of the Tree of life in the firſt place; Firſt, ſeeing God had commanded them to eat freely of every Tree of the Garden, verſe 16. And ſecondly, ſeeing God had commended unto them the Tree of life by name (for by the ſpecial name of it God did teach them to prefer it) before all the other trees in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, for their beſt good: And it is evident from Gods threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17. that ſeeing man muſt dye if he diſobeyed by eating the forbidden fruit, that Gods <note n="*" place="margin">See Mr. <hi>Ball</hi> on the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, p. 6.</note> Covenant was with <hi>Adam</hi> for life, if he had but firſt eaten of the Tree of life, and this is manifeſt by the name of the Tree, in verſ. 9. compared with Gods Irony in Chapter 3. 22. for by the name of it

God ſhewed him what operation it had by vertue of his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant<note place="margin">And Mr. <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi> in <hi>Vindicia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legis lect. 13. &amp; vindic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Therefore if the Devill had let <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> alone but one whole day to the liberty and freedome of their own created wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, doubtleſſe they would both in wiſdome, and in obedience to Gods command, and to Gods commendation of the Tree of life for their beſt good, have eaten of the Tree of life in the firſt place, as the chiefeſt and beſt food, for it tended directly to the confirmation of them, not onely in their preſent, but alſo in their future happy condition.</p>
               <p>And this the Devill knew right well, and therefore he knew that unleſſe he could by his ſubtill head-plot circumvent <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> by inticing them to eat of the Tree of knowledge of good and evill, before they did eat of the Tree of life, that he could never afterwards beguile them by any temptation whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
               <p>And it is alſo evident, that <hi>Adam</hi> did well enough know the excellent uſe of the Tree of life by the name of it, verſ. 9. as it appears by the ſpeech of the bleſſed Trinity, in <hi>Gen. 3. 22. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold ſay they, the man is become as one of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S, to know good and evill, and now leſt he put forth his hand, and take alſo of the Tree of life, and eat, and live for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This ſpeech of the bleſſed Trinity, though it be ſpoken by way of Irony to <hi>Adam</hi> after his fall, yet it implieth that <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> knew that if they had but eaten of the Tree of life in their innocency, they had been confirmed in their preſent perfect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition for ever, but now being fallen, God doth mock their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit as vain to think ſo; for a modeſt Irony hath alwayes a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary meaning to that which is ſpoken, and the ſcope of ſuch an Irony is to expreſſe a juſt reprehenſion of ſome ſin, as it may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in <hi>Judges 10. 14. 1 King. 22. 15. 1 King.</hi> 8. 27.</p>
               <p>And becauſe the Tree of life had that vertue in it at firſt by Gods Covenant and Ordinance; Therefore by way of compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon thereto, Chriſt is now called the Tree of Life, <hi>Rev. 2. 7. That whoſoever beleeveth on him, or feedeth by faith on his death, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piatory ſacrifice, or ſacrifices of Attonement</hi> (by which he hath broken the Devils head-plot) <hi>he ſhall never periſh, but have everlaſting life.</hi>

               <p>For the cralty Devil in the ſubtil Serpent knew well enough that if he had but left <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> to the liberty of their own choice, but one whole day together, they would in wiſdom, and in obedience to Gods command (that had commanded them to eat of every Tree, and in relation to Gods commendation of the Tree of life above the reſt of the fruit of the Garden) have eaten of that Tree in the firſt place; and then the Devill knew well enough by the name of that Tree, that if <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> had but firſt eaten of that fruit he had been confirmed in his happy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition for ever, and that he could not have been circumvented by any temptation whatſoever afterwards.</p>
               <p>This ſubtil and guileful head-plot of the Devil, lay not onely in the hiddenneſſe and unſeen danger of his temptation, but alſo in the ſpeedineſſe of the execution of it, for if it had not been ſpeedily put in execution, the then unſeen danger had been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by <hi>Adams</hi> wiſdome in eating of the Tree of life in the firſt place.</p>

                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:167973:13"/>1 God brought the woman to the man that he might name with a name defining her nature, and that he might mary them her together as one fleſh; and this time of <hi>Adams</hi> mariage with <hi>Eve</hi> was iuſt before his entrance into Paradiſe; but ſome unadviſed Expoſitors do confound this order, for they place the time of <hi>Adams</hi> mariage (not before, but) after he came into Paradiſe; Firſt, Becauſe it is ſaid that <hi>Adam</hi> in the ſingular number was put therein, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 8. 15. Secondly, Becauſe the womans creation and mariage is not recorded till after mention of <hi>Adams</hi> ſeating in Paradiſe, verſe 22, 23.</p>
               <p>But a ſenſible reaſon may be given to both theſe; firſt, Under the name of <hi>Adam</hi> in the ſingular number the woman is inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, becauſe God had made them but one fleſh by mariage im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately before their entrance into Paradiſe, and in that reſpect the Seventy tranſlate <hi>Yee,</hi> for <hi>Thou,</hi> in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17. becauſe they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood both of them to be comprehended under the term <hi>Thou.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore thoſe Mariage-Books, ſaith Mr. <hi>Broughton,</hi> have an over-ſight, that ſay, The woman was formed in Paradiſe; for the Commandement <hi>Thou ſhall not eat thereof,</hi> in verſ. 17. went not before the creation of the woman (nor before her mariage to <hi>Alam</hi>) but after; ſhe had the Commandement as well as <hi>Adam,</hi> in the ſame term <hi>Thou,</hi> as being but one fleſh by mariage. See <hi>Bro.</hi> in principal Poſitions Pag. 10. and the matter is out of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, for the woman doth teſtifie that the Commadement was given to them both joyntly; for thus ſaith ſhe to the Serpent, <hi>God hath ſaid, ye ſhall not eat of it, neither ſhall ye touch it leſt ye dye,</hi> Gen. 3. 3. in this ſentence ſhe doth three times over affirm that Gods prohibition was given to them both joyntly.</p>
               <p>The ſtory of the time of <hi>Adams</hi> mariage lyes thus: Firſt, God in the ſixth day created all ſorts of Beaſts of the Earth, and all ſorts of the Fowls of the air: Secondly, Then he created <hi>Adam</hi> after his own Image, as the glory of all his creation; And thirdly, then he brought all the ſaid creatures before him, that he might put ſuitable names upon them as their Lord, and that they might wait upon him as their Lord, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 19, 20. But fourthly, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe among them all, God did not find out a meet helper for <hi>Adams</hi> ſociety, thereupon God as a moſt expert Surgeon, did caſt <hi>Adam</hi> into a deep ſleep, and took out one of his Ribs, and of that Rib, as a moſt mighty Creator, he made a woman; and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:167973:14"/>
this was the laſt ſort of viſible creatures that God made. Fifthly, Then God brought her unto <hi>Adam,</hi> to ſee what <hi>Adam</hi> would call her, and he being exquiſite in underſtanding ſaid, <hi>This now is bone of my bone, and fleſh of my fleſh, ſhe ſhall be called Woman, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe was taken out of man.</hi> And ſixthly, At this inſtant, God gave her in mariage to <hi>Adam,</hi> to be as one fleſh, and to be a meet helper to him. And therefore ſecondly, the onely reaſon why the womans creation, and mariage, is not recorded till after the mention of <hi>Adams</hi> ſeating in Paradiſe, is, becauſe by the figure <hi>Hyſteron Proteron,</hi> he would ſhew the cloſe joyning of the Devils temptation, and of their Fall, to their mariage.</p>
               <p>2 This word of connexion [<hi>And</hi> or <hi>Now</hi>] hath relation to the time of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eves</hi> entrance into Paradiſe, it was [<hi>Now</hi>] namely as ſoon as God had joyned them together as one fleſh by mariage (which was done without the borders of Paradiſe) he did without delay carry them both into Paradiſe, as to the place of pleaſure that he had in a ſpecial manner prepared for their delight and comfort during the time of their innocency; There he put the man that he had formed, <hi>Gen. 2. 8. And the Lord God took the man, and put him into the Garden of Eden,</hi> Gen. 2. 15. and after his fall, thence, God ſent him forth to till the ground whence he was taken, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 23. From theſe Scriptures it is evident, that as ſoon as God had given the woman in mariage to <hi>Adam,</hi> he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently brought them both into Paradiſe, and commanded all ſorts of creatures to attend on them into Paradiſe, as on their Sovereign Lord, <hi>Gen. 1. 26, 28. Gen.</hi> 2. 19. and this is alſo evident, becauſe the Serpent was there ready among the other Beaſts of the field to do ſervice to them, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 1. And becauſe God had made man to be the glory of his whole creation, he did command, not onely his earthly creatures, but his heavenly Angels alſo, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend upon them into Paradiſe, as it may be gathered, becauſe God doth ſtill command his Angels to attend upon ſuch as he hath<note place="margin">The time of the fall of the Angels, n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Our minds (ſaith Mr. <hi>Bro.</hi> in <hi>Req.</hi> of Conſent. pag. 75.) cannot once think of any other ſubject in God (who dwelleth in terrible light) againſt which the Devill durſt ſpurn, neither deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth he but to hurt man; as ſtill ſhewing that from hatred to man was his Fall.</p>
               <p>Envy (ſaith <hi>Lanquet</hi>) came firſt of Sathan, for envying the feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of man whom God had created and ſet in Paradiſe, he chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged himſelf into an Angel of light, abuſing the wiſdome of the Serpent to deceive man. See <hi>Marbek's</hi> Common-places, pag. 339.</p>
               <p>At the creation of the woman (which was the laſt particular kind of all Gods creation) the Angels were not fallen; for at the end of Gods viſible creation on the ſixth day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is ſaid, <hi>That God ſaw all that he had made, and loe it was very good,</hi> Gen. 1. 31.</p>
               <p>From this Text it may certainly be gathered, that no creature was yet become bad; and therefore that the Angels were not fallen when the woman was created; but their fall was preſently after the woman was created and given in mariage to <hi>Adam;</hi> all which was done without the borders of Paradiſe, but then God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to bring them into Paradiſe, all creatures whom <hi>Adam</hi> had named as their Lord were to attend upon him, and then God gave his Angels charge alſo to atend upon them (as I have
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:167973:15"/>
formerly noted it to be a chief part of their office, from <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 14. becauſe God intended to dignifie mans nature, not onely above all his viſible creatures, but even above Angels alſo, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 10. But the Angels not knowing Gods eternal Counſel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning mans dignity, which ſhould be ſo much advanced through Chriſt, diſ-eſteemed man (as being made but of the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt element) in compariſon of themſelves that were ſpirits in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible, and of a heavenly nature, and in that reſpect they refuſed to obey Gods poſitive command, in refuſing to attend upon <hi>Adam,</hi> and then as many of them as refuſed that ſervice and ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in which God had ſet them, were by Gods juſtice deprived of their moral perfections, and are ever ſince become an envious company to mans good.</p>

               <p>The Image of God wherewith <hi>Adams</hi> Nature was adorned, would have kept him, and all his Poſterity for ever from death, if he had but firſt eaten of the Tree of Life; but becauſe he did firſt eat of the forbidden Fruit, he was deprived of Gods Image; And then ſecondly, Death in Sin fell upon his Nature.</p>

               <p>And he asketh this queſtion, How can the Soul dye the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Death?

               <p>2 The ſecond degree of that Death threatned in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17. was death in ſin, and this death fell upon <hi>Adams</hi> nature at the very<note place="margin">See <hi>Perkins</hi> in the right way of dying wel.</note> inſtant, as ſoon as God had ſubſtracted his Image from him; for we ſee by experience, that as ſoon as the God of Nature hath ſubſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted the light of the Sun from our Horizon, there remains no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but obſcure darkneſs, and then no Artificers, nor Scholars can work, or write after their Maſters perfect Copy, but inſtead thereof, they work, and act irregularly, and tranſgreſs againſt their Maſters copy; Even ſo, as ſoon as God in Juſtice had ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted the Light and Life of his Image from <hi>Adam,</hi> what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained but obſcure darkneſs in his minde, and then what could he do elſe but think and act irregularly, and that continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as long as he did continue in that darkneſs? and this dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs after the light it ſelf is myſtically applied to mans corrupt eſtate, <hi>Eph. 4. 18.

then follows a defect, or want of righteouſneſs, and I may alſo ſay, then follows a natural proneſs to all kinde of iniquity, ſo that the very thoughts and imaginations of the heart are only e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and that continually, and this frame is called Original ſin to us, though <hi>Adams</hi> Original ſin was his actual eating of the forbid-Fruit; and this is the ſecond degree of that death threatned in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17.</p>
               <p>3 A third degree of that death was, that Adam was now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the power and ſlavery of Satan (which had the power of death, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 14.) to do his wil and pleaſure in all things to the full, and to be under the power of a Tyrant is death, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18. 4. But it pleaſed God in his eternal Counſel and Providence to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide Jeſus Chriſt to take poſſeſſion of the world as the right Heir of it, as ſoon as <hi>Adam</hi> fel, and ſo to uphold all things by the word of his power, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 2, 3. by which means both Satans power, tyranny, and malice, and mans corrupt deſires and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours are reſtrained, and ordered ſo, that now they cannot<note place="margin">See <hi>Capel</hi> on <hi>Tempt</hi> p. 55, 56. and ſee mere in ch. 3. in <hi>R.</hi> 2.</note> do that wickedneſs which elſe they would do; and were it not for this Government of Chriſt at the inſtant of <hi>Adams</hi> fall, no man can imagine what deſtructive miſchiefs would have faln at that very inſtant upon the whole Creation, which was the very thing that Satan aimed at in his temptation; but bleſſed be God that provided Jeſus Chriſt againſt that time of need.</p>
               <p>But after this digreſſion in ſetting out the degrees of the firſt Spiritual death, as it muſt be underſtood, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17. I will now return to ſpeak a little more of the Devils ſpeech and ſubtilty, in deceiving the Woman, and in making her his inſtrument to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive <hi>Adam;</hi> The Devil did not deal with the Woman about any Morall diſobedience (as he did with Chriſt, after he had tried him with many other temptations for forty days together) for he knew that <hi>Adams</hi> nature was framed after Gods Image in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of Moral perfection, but he deals with her about poſitive commands only, for he knew that ſhe was not ſo perfect in the knowledge of thoſe things by Creation, as ſhe was in all Moral things; he knew that the Woman was ignorant as yet of the poſitive Law that was given to the Angels to attend upon them, (as the viſible Creatures were,) for they being Spirits, their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and actions were not ſubject to be diſcerned by bodily ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and in that reſpect alſo <hi>Eve</hi> was ignorant of their diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

and fall, and ſhe was alſo ignorant that they had obtained leave of God to tempt her about the Tree of Knowledge (which was a thing indifferent in its own nature to be eaten, or refuſed) but if the Woman had but known of theſe things, then her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and Natural wiſdome would have fortified her will againſt all Satans temptations whatſoever; for we ſee by the example of Chriſt, that when the Devil did perſwade him by <hi>Peters</hi> tongue to pitty himſelf, and not to go to <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> to ſuffer, then Chriſt could not be deceived by his perſwaſions, becauſe he knew that <hi>Peters</hi> tongue was acted by Satan, and therefore hee ſaid unto <hi>Peter, Get thee behind me Satan, thou art an offence unto me,</hi> Mat. 16. 23. but for the manner of this knowledge, the Woman could not call this Angel Satan, and therefore ſhe could not reſiſt ſo ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly, as elſe doubtleſs ſhe would have done; yea, if the Angels that fell had but known of Mans glory by Gods election in Chriſt, they would not have refuſed to ſerve man, for in this manner the Apoſtle doth reaſon about the Sin of the Princes of this World, had they but known (ſaith he) of the hidden Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, which he ordained before the world unto our glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, they would not have Crucified the Lord of glory, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 7, 8. ſo I may ſay of the Womans Fall, if ſhe had but known of the fall of Angels, ſhe would not have been deceived by the Serpent.</p>
               <p>But becauſe the Woman was ignorant of thoſe poſitive Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets (and God was pleaſed not to reveal them to her as yet) ſhe was deceived, and then ſhe was eaſily made Satans Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to deceive her Husband; and then they did experimentally know that ſome of the Angels were faln, and that they had leave of God to tempt them, and that the Devil was a Liar, and a Murtherer from the beginning, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 44. The <hi>Syriack</hi> on the word <hi>Beginning,</hi> is <hi>Men Breſbith,</hi> that is, by all Rabbins, within the days of Creation, and ſaith Mr. <hi>Perkins,</hi> Our Saviour calls<note place="margin">See <hi>Perkins</hi> on the Creed.</note> the Devil a Man-ſlayer from the beginning, not from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Creation, or of Time, but of Man; and ſeeing (ſaith he) it is the nature of the Devil to ſhew his malice (againſt Man) without ceaſing, no doubt but he took the firſt occaſion that might poſſible be had to bring man to the ſame Damnation with himſelf.</p>
               <p>And why is the Devil ſaid to go up and down, or to walk a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,

ſeeking whom he may devour, like a roaring Lion? but to expreſs his ſpeedy diligence in his firſt temptation, as well as in his after temptations? 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 8.</p>
               <p>And why is the Devil called the Old Serpent, <hi>Revel.</hi> 12. but from his ancient deceiving of the underſtanding and will of our firſt Parents?

               <p>
                  <hi>Adam</hi> did not lodge a night in Honour, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49. 12. for hee was deprived of the glorious Image of God, namely, of his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and Natural perfections, before night came.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Theophilact</hi> ſaith, As man was formed the ſixth day, and did eat of the forbidden Fruit at the ſixth hour; ſo Chriſt healing the Fall, was faſtned to the Tree the ſixth day, and the ſixth hour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Auſtin</hi> alſo is of opinion, that <hi>Adam</hi> ſtood in his innocency but ſix hours only.</p>
               <p>From all this Diſcourſe in this reaſon, though it be long, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I have interlaced ſeveral collateral conſiderations, yet (I hope profitable to the underſtanding of the weaker ſort) this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion follows, That the Devil had not deſerved the name of a ſubtile Serpent, if he had not preſently, and without delay, (namely as ſoon as <hi>Adam</hi> had received the Commandement, to eat of all the Trees in the Garden, and of the Tree of Life a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the reſt) brought him by his ſubtilty to eat of the Tree of Knowledge of good and Evil in the firſt place, before he had ſo much liberty as to go firſt to the Tree of Life; for the Devil knew that if <hi>Adam</hi> had had but a little time free from his temptation, his created Wiſdome was ſuch, that he would have eaten of the Tree of Life in the firſt place, and then the Devil had not deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the name of a ſubtile Serpent; but becauſe the Devil by his ſpeedy ſubtilty brought our firſt Parents to eat of the forbidden Fruit in the firſt place, before they had liberty in the day of their
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:167973:19"/>
Creation, to eat of the Tree of Life, therefore it follows,</p>
               <p n="1">1 That the Devil hath juſtly deſerved the name of a ſubtile Serpent.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Hence it alſo follows, that the Sabbath was not ordained in the time of <hi>Adams</hi> innocency, but after his Fall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ. 5. Adam</hi> fell in the day of his Creation, becauſe he fell<note place="margin">The Woman fell while ſhe was a Virgin, therefore <hi>Adam</hi> fell in the day of his Creation.</note> while the Woman was a Virgin, namely before he knew her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the manner of all fleſh.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> had ſlept but one night together in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, doubtleſſe in wiſdome they would not have omitted the act of Generation.</p>

               <p n="1">1 That they would not have omitted the act of Generation as ſoon as they had a fit opportunity, which they ſhould have had if they had ſlept but one night together in their innocency.</p>

               <p>The Apoſtle compares the guiles of falſe Teachers to the guiles of Satan, and he compares their ſincere mindes, as long as they kept faſt to the Truth, to the Virgin <hi>Eve,</hi> for ſo long as they kept their mindes unpolluted with falſe Doctrin, they were Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin-like; but as <hi>Eve</hi> the Virgin was beguiled, and defiled by Satans fair but falſe Doctrin; ſo the Apoſtle feared leſt their minds ſhould be corrupted, by the fair though falſe Doctrin of their falſe Teachers, from that plaineſſe that is towards Chriſt, for the Tempter did tempt them by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſeducing Teachers, 1 <hi>Theſſal.</hi> 3. 5. and the Spirit (ſaith the Apoſtle) ſpeaketh evidently, that in the latter days, (namely in the days of the Goſpel) ſome ſhould depart from the Faith, giving heed to ſeducing Spirits, and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrins of Devils, 1 <hi>Timothy</hi> 4. 1. as the Virgin <hi>Eve</hi> once did.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Proving by three Reaſons that <hi>Adam</hi> was Re-created in the very ſame day in which he was Created and Fell.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>1. IT is evident to me that <hi>Adam</hi> was Re-created in the very ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame<note place="margin">Reaſon 1.</note> day in which he was created and fell, by the order of Gods dealing with him immediately after his Fall.</p>
               <p>For immediately after he had bitten of the forbidden fruit, and was thereby dead in corruption and ſin from the life of Gods Image in which he was created, Then God of his rich mercy came to him in the <note n="*" place="margin">The cool (or wind) of the day means the Even tide as the Seventy tranſlate it, which begins at Mid-day, for the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing begins when the Sun begins to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline, and then there doth uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ariſe a cooling wind (called a Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn) which the God of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to cool the air in hot Countries.</note> cool (or in the wind) of the ſame day, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 8. to confer with him, and to enquire of him into what ſtate and condition he had brought himſelf by eating of the forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den fruit, ſaying unto him by way of Query, <hi>Adam, Where art thou?</hi> not in what particular place art thou? (as ſome ignorant perſons do underſtand it, for God was come to the very place where <hi>Adam</hi> was;) But into what caſe haſt thou brought thy ſelf by eating of the forbidden fruit? And unto this ſearching Query, <hi>Adam</hi> made a plain Anſwer, ſaying in ver. 10. <hi>I heard thy voyce walking in the Garden, and I was afraid; and becauſe I was naked of thy Image in which I was created, I hid my ſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This plain Anſwer of <hi>Adam</hi> doth imply two things; 1 His fear of Gods wrath. 2 The Reaſon of it.</p>
               <p>1 His fear of Gods wrath in theſe words, <hi>I heard thy voyce walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Garden;</hi> the word implies, <hi>That it walked along by him like roaring Thunder among the trees of the Garden.</hi> And with ſuch a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full voice Chriſt manifeſted himſelf to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> when he gave the Law at Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> to awaken and over-aw their ſinful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 8. compared with <hi>Ex.</hi> 19. 16. doth manifeſt and explain the matter; and in this reſpect the dreadfull voice of Thunder is called Gods voice, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 29. 3. And this dreadfull voice of God did ſo terrifie his guilty conſcience, that it forced <hi>Adam</hi> to ſay, <hi>I heard thy voice walking like Thunder in the Garden, and I was afraid;</hi> for the guilt of his conſcience told him that he had grievouſly tranſgreſſed againſt Gods poſitive command in ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the forbidden fruit.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:167973:21"/>2 He gives another reaſon why he hid himſelf among the trees of the Garden, namely becauſe I was naked both in body and ſoul of my created qualities, and therefore I hid my ſelf among the trees of the Garden.</p>
               <p>And thus <hi>Adams</hi> conſcience was convinced of his ſin, and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with Gods dreadfull voice of inquiry concerning his ſin and guilt, and thereupon he made a plain confeſſion, <hi>That he was afraid, and that he hid himſelf becauſe he was naked.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Text runs thus, in <hi>Gen. 3. 8. They heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the Garden in the cool (or in the wind) of the day: And</hi> Adam <hi>and his wife hid themſelves from the preſence of the Lord God among the trees of the Garden,</hi> verſ. 9. <hi>And the Lord God called unto</hi> Adam, <hi>and ſaid unto him, Where are thou?</hi> verſ. 10. <hi>And he ſaid, Who told thee that thou waſt naked? Haſt thou eaten of the Tree whereof I commanded thee that thou ſhouldeſt not eat?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And by this ſearching Query, <hi>Adam, Where art thou? Adam</hi> was convinced, and terrified with the ſenſe of his ſin, and with the dread of Gods wrath; and when he ſaw that he could by no means eſcape it, he made a plain confeſſion of his ſin and miſery, and that he hid himſelf, becauſe he was naked of Gods Image, and ſubject to inordinate luſts, and thereupon to ſhame and horror of conſcience; and in like ſort it is ſaid that <hi>Aaron</hi> made the people naked to their ſhame when he made a Molten Calf for them to worſhip as a God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 25. for by that ſin God was departed from them, and ſo they were made naked both of Gods graces, and of Gods protection, and the like is expreſſed in <hi>Rev. 3. 18. Rev. 16. 15. Ezek. 16. 22. Hoſ. 2. 3. 2. Cor.</hi> 5. 3.</p>
               <p>God did purpoſely enter into a parly and communication with <hi>Adam,</hi> that thereby he might prepare him for a Reconciliation, ſaying to him in ver. 11. <hi>Who told thee that thou art naked?</hi> By this and the former ſearching Queries, God was pleaſed to help <hi>Adam</hi> to ſearch himſelf the more deeply, and to affect him the more throughly with the ſight of his ſin, and with the ſenſe of his miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſpiritual death in ſin, becauſe he intended to ſhew him mercy; but the Lord did not propound any ſuch ſearching Queries to the fallen Angels, becauſe he intended not to ſhew any merciful At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement or Reconciliation to them, though notwithſtanding he hath ſhewed ſome common mercy to them in that he hath not ſunk them into the loweſt hell as yet, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. 29. But judgement
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:167973:21"/>
without Mercy to them he hath deferred till the Day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, 2 <hi>Pet. 2. 4. 2 Theſ.</hi> 1. 9.</p>
               <p>And theſe ſearching queres made <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> to anſwer (as thoſe that are deeply convinced, and humbled in the ſight and ſenſe of their Spiritual nakedneſſe and miſery) that they had eaten of the forbidden Fruit; and they freely confeſſed (without any extenuation) after what manner they were brought unto it; <hi>The woman</hi> (ſaith <hi>Adam,</hi> in verſ. 12.) <hi>which thou gaveſt to be with me, ſhe gave me of the tree, and I did eat;</hi> even ſhe that was made of my Rib, and ſhe that thou gaveſt to be a meet Helper unto me,<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 12. Gen. 3. 13.</note> ſhe gave it unto me, and therefore I took it from her hand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (from whom I could ſuſpect no hurt) and did eat.</p>
               <p>And the Lord ſaid unto the Woman, what is this that thou haſt done? or, why haſt thou done this? And the Woman ſaid, <hi>The Serpent</hi> (whom thou gaveſt to attend upon us, as a diligent and faithful ſervant) <hi>beguiled me, and I did eat,</hi> ver. 13. I thought the Serpent had been acted by a good Angel, that could not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade to ſin; and by this word <hi>Beguiled</hi> the woman compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended the whole manner and order of the Devils deceitful temptation.</p>
               <p>Some Interpreters I grant do conceive, That <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> in their ſeveral anſwers, did not make a plaine confeſſion, but did rather labour to extenuate their ſin, by poſting it off from themſelves to others, but all circumſtances conſidered, their anſwers and confeſſions muſt needs be plain and naked, or elſe they had not been fit to imbrace the means of Reconciliation which God was now pleaſed to manifeſt unto them.</p>
               <p>And therefore without delay God did firſt curſe the Serpent, as it was the Devils inſtrument, in verſ. 14. and then ſecondly, he curſeth the Devil himſelf, in ver. 15. ſaying, <hi>I will put enmity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thee and the Woman, and between thy ſeed and her ſeed;</hi> He, even He, ſhall break thy head, and thou ſhalt peirce Him in the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoals. Thus God did threaten the Devil in the Serpent, namely, to break in peeces his ſubtil Head-plot by the work of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Reconciliation, which ſhould be wrought by the Seed of this Woman, which the Devil had poyſoned and corrupted, thinking thereby to deſtroy all Man-kinde that ſhould come of her to the end of the World; but God threatned the Devil to break this Head-plot of his, and that he woud put ſuch an enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:167973:22"/>
in the Seed of the Woman againſt him and his ſeed, as ſhould prevail, and bring them all to a deeper ruine at laſt; and as God did thus curſe the Devils Head-plot to ruinate it by the Seed of the Woman, in the hearing and preſence of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> (to whom it was a Prophetical Prediction and a Promiſe) ſo que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionleſſe he did not fail to inſtruct them more fully herein, and after what manner this Seed of the Woman ſhould break the Devils Head-plot, namely, that through Death he ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy him that had the power of Death, that is the Devil, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 2. 14. and that he ſhould ſpoil Principalities and Powers, and make a ſhew of them openly, triumphing over them in his Death on the Croſſe, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 15. for he overcame him that had the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Death by Death, for his Soul was not ſeparated from his Body by the power of Satan, and his inſtruments, and by the power of their tortures, but by his own power, and in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect his death was accepted of God as a propitiatory Sacrifice of Attonement, and reconciliation. This good news of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation by this means was no doubt heartily welcome to poor dejected <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve;</hi> they being fully loſt and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in their own Conſciences, did out of doubt receive this Prophetical demonſtration of their Redemption, and Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, with all gladneſs and joyfulneſs of Spirit, for true hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled ſinners are fit to take down ſuch Cordials with joyfulneſs, and God was pleaſed to open their minds and hearts to beleeve in this Seed of the Woman, and to imbrace this bleſſed means of their Reconciliation by his Death and Sacrifice, which he ſhould accompliſh in due time, even then when the Devil ſhould peirce him in the Foot-ſoals upon the Croſſe, and by this means God was pleaſed to Re-create <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> in the cool of the ſame day wherein they were created and fell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. Secondly, it is evident that <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> were re-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Adam</hi> doth te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie that he was Recreated in the day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of his Creation and Fall, by giving his wife the new name <hi>Hevah,</hi> life.</note> in the day of their Creation and Fall, becauſe <hi>Adam</hi> did teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie both his Wifes faith, and his own faith, by calling her <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah,</hi> Life; for <hi>Adam</hi> gave this new Name to his Wife as ſoon as God had manifeſted the deſtroying of Satans Head-plot through the work of Reconciliation by the Seed of the Woman.</p>
               <p>Before the ſaid threatning to break the Devils Head-plot by the Seed of the Woman, <hi>Adam</hi> called his Wifes name <hi>Iſha,</hi> Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, or of Man, becauſe ſhe was taken out of man, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 23.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:167973:22"/>
but after the ſaid threatning to ruinate the Devils Head-plot, by reconciling Man by the Seed of the Woman, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. then in verſ. 20. <hi>Adam</hi> called his Wife <hi>Hevah,</hi> that is to ſay, Life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe was the Mother of Life, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 20. or the Mother of that Seed that gives life from the death of ſin, and in this reſpect ſhe is alſo the Mother of all that are elected to live the life of faith; and from this preſident it is uſual in Scripture to give new names upon new occaſions, eſpecially upon the manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome new work of Grace upon any, as <hi>Gen. 17. 5. Eſ. 62. 2. Revel.</hi> 3. 12.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adam</hi> was not ſo ſenceleſs to give his Wiſe the new Name <hi>Hevah,</hi> becauſe ſhe was the firſt living Woman, or the firſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Natural life to others, for all men know that it cannot be otherwiſe; and therefore it follows by good conſequence, that <hi>Adam</hi> did give her that new Name by way of excellency, namely, becauſe ſhe had now received the new life of Faith in that ſeed of hers, that ſhould break the Devils Head-plot. And ſecondly, becauſe ſhe was the firſt Woman that did live by faith, therefore ſhe muſt needs be the Mother of all that ſhould after live by faith in her Seed Chriſt, and in that reſpect ſhe, as well, or rather more fully than <hi>Sara,</hi> may well be called the Mother of all that do live by faith, 1 <hi>Pet. 3. 6. Gal.</hi> 4. 22. 28. 31.</p>
               <p>2 As <hi>Adam</hi> doth teſtifie his Wives faith, ſo alſo he doth fully teſtifie his own faith in giving her the new name <hi>Hevah;</hi> his faith is fully evident by this, becauſe by this new name he did ſo clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtinguiſh her preſent new Spiritual condition from her cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted condition.</p>
               <p>Immediatly before this, not only the Woman, but <hi>Adam</hi> alſo were Spiritually dead in corruption and ſin; but it pleaſed God to take ſuch a ſpeedy courſe for their humiliation and convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and for their reconciliation and converſion by the Seed of the Woman, that <hi>Adam</hi> thereupon, in teſtimony both of his own faith and of his Wifes faith, did by way of excellency call her <hi>Hevah,</hi> and ſo he changed her name from <hi>Iſha</hi> to <hi>Hevah,</hi> that is to ſay, from woman to life.</p>
               <p>And thus we have ſeen how the Seed of the Woman, Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, did honour his firſt Parents with the life of faith, and as hee did honour them, ſo doubtleſſe he did continue to honour all his Natural Parents after the fleſh (ſooner or latter) with the like
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:167973:23"/>
honour of the life of faith, and therefore they do ill that make the ſeveral wicked Kings of <hi>Solomons</hi> houſe, in <hi>Matth.</hi> 1. to bee his Fathers after the fleſh; Chriſt came not of <hi>Solomons</hi> houſe, as the Apoſtate <hi>Jews,</hi> and ſome unadviſed Chriſtians do hold, but he comes of <hi>Solomons</hi> brother called <hi>Nathan</hi> (and all his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Fathers are laid down in <hi>Luke</hi> 3.) and I make no queſtion but he did honour every one of them with the grace of true faith, according to his firſt example; and this may teach all good children to honour their Parents with their beſt abilities.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3. It is evident that <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> were re-created in<note place="margin">The converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our firſt Parents is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in the Womans en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity againſt the Serpent and his Seed.</note> the day of their Creation and Fall, by the word <hi>enmity</hi> againſt the Serpent; <hi>I will</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>put enmity between thee and the Woman.</hi>

               <p>At the firſt the Woman looked upon the Serpent as a faithful and diligent ſervant for her good, and that the Angel that gave it ſpeech was a good Angel, and therefore the Woman was in great amity with them, and with the Serpents fair and ſpecious perſwaſions; but now God told the Devil in the Serpent, that he would from this time forth put enmity inſtead <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </argument>
               <p>I Will labour to make this evident by a double inference:</p>

               <p>But for the better diſcerning of the ſaid Inferences, I will firſt labour to explain the text in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 1, 2, 3.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>And the Heavens and the Earth were Finiſhed, and all the Hoſt of them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>And before the ſeventh day, God had finiſhed the work that he had made; And he reſted on the ſeventh day from all the work that he had made.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Verſe 3. <hi>And God bleſſed the ſeventh day, and ſanctified it, becauſe in it he had reſted from all his works which God had created and made.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Two things muſt be marked for the better underſtanding of theſe words.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Touching the tranſlation of the word <hi>Before,</hi> in verſ. 2.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Touching the circumſtance of time: namely, after how much time, or Chronology of ſtory, the ſecond and third verſes concerning the Inſtitution of the Sabbath muſt be placed.</p>
               <p>1 Touching the tranſlation of the word [<hi>Before</hi>] the ſeventh day, verſ. 2.</p>
               <p n="1">1 The Seventy Tranſlators tranſlate it thus; In the ſixth day God ended all his works, they put the ſixth day into the Text inſtead of the ſeventh day, and this they did, leſt the Heathens, at whoſe requeſt that Tranſlation was made, ſhould think that God ended his works in the ſeventh day.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Therefore, to prevent this, and ſuch like groſſe miſtakes, I have made choice to follow Mr. <hi>Broughtons</hi> correction of the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva</hi> Tranſlation, where inſtead of <hi>In the ſeventh day,</hi> he reads <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſeventh day, God had finiſhed the work that he had made.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>2 The word [<hi>Before</hi>] is better than the word [<hi>In</hi>] becauſe it is more agreeable to the ſenſe of the words adjoyning; for the frame of the next words are delivered in the Pretertenſe, <hi>Had finiſhed, Had made<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c.</hi> Theſe termes do carry the work of the Creation to have been Finiſhed, not <hi>In,</hi> but <hi>Before the ſeventh day;</hi> as if <hi>Moſes</hi> in more words had ſaid thus,</p>

                  <hi>That work which God had made but mutably perfect in the former part of the ſixth day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he had alſo finiſhed it by a Re-creation moſt certainly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, Before the ſeventh day; That is to ſay, in the latter part of the ſixth day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
               </p>
               <p>3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Mr. <hi>Ainſworth</hi> ſheweth that the Prepoſition <hi>In<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

In the eyes of the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Iſrael,</hi> is better read thus, <hi>Before the eyes of the Elders of Iſrael,</hi> likewiſe in <hi>Deut. 25. 9.

               <p>I grant that the letter of this Prepoſition doth differ from that in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 2. but yet by the rules of Grammar they muſt ſuffer the like variation, when there is the like cauſe, the difference of the letter doth nothing alter the caſe.</p>
               <p>So in the eyes of <hi>Jehovah, Deut. 4. 25<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Deut.</hi> 31. 29. is better read thus, <hi>Before the eyes of Jehovah;</hi> So in the New Teſtament it is ſaid,<note place="margin">See <hi>Ainſ</hi> alſo in Gen. 366. and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>So then from all theſe conſiderations, it is cleer that the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Prepoſition ought ſometimes to be tranſlated <hi>Before,</hi> and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:167973:25"/>
                  <hi>After,</hi> as well as In, not onely in reſpect of perſon and place, but alſo in reſpect of time; and therefore this Text of <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 2. ought to be tranſlated thus, Before the ſeventh day, God had finiſhed (namely by a Re-creation) the work that he had made; the <hi>Greek</hi> tranſlate the work which God had begun to make, for at firſt it was made but mutably perfect in the former part of the ſixth day.</p>
               <p>2 The next conſiderable Rule of direction for the right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of theſe three verſes, is the circumſtance of time, namely after how much of the Hiſtory of <hi>Adam</hi> muſt theſe three verſes ſucceed, according to the rule of true Chronology.</p>
               <p>This conſideration is a Rule of great importance to find out the true ſenſe of theſe three verſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> My Anſwer to this Query is this, namely that theſe three verſes muſt in order of time be placed at the end of the third Chapter; As it hath been well obſerved, both by the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors, and by ſundry Chriſtian Writers, as I have noted it in <hi>R.</hi> 1. and p. 1. And ſee alſo Dr. <hi>Leightfoots</hi> Chronolgy for this; and <hi>Samuel Torſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>l</hi> in his Deſign about diſpoſing the Bible into an Harmony, he doth in p. 10. direct us to place the three firſt verſes of <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 1, 2, 3. at the end of the third Chapter, and ſo doth Mr. <hi>Bro.</hi> alſo.</p>
               <p>I have alſo noted in Chap. 18. that the only reaſon why <hi>Moſes</hi> doth place theſe three verſes at the beginning of the ſecond Chapter is this; namely, becauſe he had begun to ſet down the ſtory of all the ſix working dayes in <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. therefore he thought it meet to ſet down the ſtory of the ſeventh day in the next place; and ſo he hath placed the brief ſtory of all the ſeven dayes of the week together, that ſo he might take the more liberty afterwards to return again unto the large ſtory of <hi>Adams</hi> Creation, Fall, and Redemption, from the ſeventh verſe of the ſecond Chapter to the end of the third Chapter: All which ſtory fell out upon the ſixth day, and therefore the ordination<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the Sabbath, though it be ſet in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 2, 3. yet in the order of Chronology, it muſt be ſet after the third Chapter of <hi>Geneſis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This conſideration may ſerve as a neceſſary Rule to guide us in the right apprehending, and underſtanding of ſundry words in the ſaid three verſes, which elſe cannot be fully and rightly underſtood; for we muſt expound theſe three verſes as if
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:167973:25"/>
they had been placed at the end of the third Chapter.</p>
               <p>And this is no new device of mans brain, but it is an uſual thing for the Pen-men of the holy Scriptures, to make ſuch like diſlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of Chapters and verſes; and in that reſpect the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors do ſay, that there is no <hi>Order of former and latter in the Law,</hi> for oftentimes the Pen-men of the holy Scriptures do ſet that which is after, Before; and ſo conſequently we muſt by the rule of Chronology place the Inſtitution of the Sabbath after the third Chapter, though <hi>Moſes</hi> for the reaſon aforeſaid, hath ſet it in the beginning of the ſecond Chapter.</p>
               <p>So then by this rule of direction, I hope it will be eaſie to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern that theſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> three verſes muſt be expounded with relation to the ſtory of <hi>Adams</hi> Fall, Re-creation, and Reconciliation by the Promiſed-Seed. And therefore it follows by neceſſary conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, that <hi>Adams</hi> Re-creation by the Seed of the woman, muſt be conſidered as the finiſhing act of the ſix dayes creation, before the ſeventh day was ordained to be a Sabbath.</p>
               <p>And by this Rule of Expoſition, many words alſo in the ſaid three verſes muſt be ſo expounded, as having a holy equivoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in them, namely, as having a myſticall ſenſe, as well as a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terall.</p>
               <p>As for example, under this word <hi>Made</hi> and <hi>Created,</hi> muſt be underſtood the myſtical and ſpiritual Creation, as well as the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral and viſible Creation: And under the word Finiſhed muſt be underſtood not only the finiſhing of the viſible Creation, but of the myſticall and ſpirituall Creation alſo; which muſt be fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, I mean ſome of that kind, by the Seed of the woman, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Hoſt of Heaven can be ſaid to be finiſhed (for the Hoſt of the third heavens muſt be finiſhed, as well as the Hoſt of the viſible heavens) before the end of the ſixth day.</p>
               <p>The like myſtical interpretation I ſhall give of the word Reſted, Bleſſed, &amp;c. when I come at them.</p>
               <p>In brief, I apprehend that there are ten ſeverall words in the ſaid three verſes that muſt be expounded in a myſtical ſenſe as well as in a literal.</p>

               <p>But all the ſeverall ſorts and kinds of creatures which apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to the Hoſt of heaven and earth were finiſhed before the ſeventh day, as the text doth plainly ſpeak.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> therefore muſt not onely fall into the ſpiritual death of ſin, in the day of their creation, but they muſt alſo be Re-created the ſame day, as a principal ſort of thoſe creatures, which God did create and provide, both for his earthly, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo for his heavenly Hoſt; for the Text ſaith, <hi>That the Heavens and the Earth were finiſhed, and all the Hoſt of them:</hi> which muſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of every ſeveral ſort of Hoſt, not numerically of the whole number, but ſpecifically of the ſeverall kinds of each Hoſt, for no new thing of a new kind was created after the ſixth day.</p>
               <p>Therefore ſeeing God did finiſh all the Hoſt of heaven and earth before the ſeventh day, he muſt needs Re-create <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> before the ſeventh day, that ſo they might be a part of his Militant Church, Hoſt, or Army, here upon earth, to maintain an utter enmity againſt Sathan and his ſeed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. and ſo from the firſt ſixth day, and forwards, God will have a Militant Church to continue here upon earth to fight the warfare of Chriſt againſt Sathan and his ſeed to the end of the world.</p>

               <p>From the frame of theſe words as they are laid down in the Pretertenſe it is evident, that before the ſeventh day, namely in the latter part of the ſixth day, God had finiſhed ſome of that work which he had made but mutably perfect in the former part of the ſixth day; Hence I reaſon thus,</p>
               <p>God had made ſome of his works ſo mutably perfect in the former part of the ſixth day, that there needed a new act of fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing, or perfecting the ſame before the ſeventh day; and what elſe can that finiſhing act be, but <hi>Adams</hi> Re-creation by the Promiſed Seed, and the putting of all the re reſt of the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at the very inſtant of <hi>Adams</hi> fall under the Dominion and Lordſhip of the Promiſed Seed?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:167973:27"/>And this muſt needs be ſo, becauſe God had made, appointed, or fore ordained Chriſt to be the right Heir of all his Creation, and uphold all things by the word of his powerfull provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 2, 3. and in that reſpect, <hi>Adam</hi> muſt fall and be Re-created on the day of his creation, that ſo the right Heir Chriſt Jeſus might come into actual poſſeſſion of all the Creation, by means whereof, the Heavens and the Earth, and all their Hoſt, was finiſhed, before the ſeventh day; and in this reſpect Chriſt is emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently ſtiled <hi>Jehovah Sabbaoth,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>The Lord of all Hoſts, Pſ.</hi> 24. 10. becauſe they were made for his ſervice, that he as their proper Lord might rule them, and govern them all, for it is ſaid,<note place="margin">See alſo ch. 4 &amp; ch. 6 at Sixthly.</note> 
                  <hi>That by him all things conſiſt,</hi> Col. 1. 17. and in this reſpect alſo, he is called <hi>The Lord of all the whole world, and of all things therein,</hi> Joſ. 3. 11.

               <p>It follows therefore that God ordained Chriſt to be the right Heir, and ſole Governour of all the Hoſts both of heaven and earth, on the ſixth day, and before God could be ſaid to reſt on the ſeventh day.</p>
               <p>1 God made <hi>Adam</hi> in the former part of the ſixth day after his own Image, as the glory of all his Creation, and gave him Dominion over all his viſible creatures, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 26. 28. But it pleaſed God in his divine Wiſdome, to make <hi>Adam</hi> but mutably happy, that ſo he might fall by the ſleight of Sathan, and loſe his pure qualities wherein he was created after Gods Image, and that he might thereby alſo loſe his Dominion over all the viſible Creation, that ſo Chriſt the right Heir might have the poſſeſſion of all, for as ſoon as <hi>Adam</hi> fell by his diſobedience in eating the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden fruit, both <hi>Adam,</hi> and all the Creation did preſently fall into confuſion and diſorder: And thereupon Sathan might well triumph, and boaſt as he did in the dayes of <hi>Job,</hi> that he had walked to and ſro in the earth as the Lord and Conqueror of it, becauſe he had not onely brought <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> into Captivity under the ſpiritual death of ſin, and the whole Creation into confuſion and diſorder, but alſo becauſe he had robbed the holy Trinity of all the glory of their glorious Creation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:167973:27"/>2 God was pleaſed in his infinite Wiſdome and Providence to let all this come to paſſe, that ſo the holy Trinity might take occaſion thereby to declare unto fallen Man, how wonderful they were in Counſel, and how excellent in working, in that they could tell how to make Man mutably perfect, and how to let Man fall by the ſleight of Satan, and how to break the Devils Head-plot by the promiſed Seed, and how to reconcile and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>create Man, and how to make fallen Man know, and honour his Creators, more than otherwiſe he could ever have done, if hee had ſtood ſtill in his firſt integrity of Nature; for if <hi>Adam</hi> had ſtill continued in his Created perfections, he could not have honoured the Mediator (ſo as he did after his Fall) ſeeing hee needed not a Mediator in that condition; neither could he have ſo much honoured Gods Mercy in the Mediator as he did after his Fall and Re-creation.</p>
               <p>3 By this time I think any man may eaſily ſee the reaſon why all the three Perſons in the God-head had a hand in the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the World, and more eminently in the Creation of Man, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 26. ſurely the chief reaſon was, That God might make<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Adam</hi> in his Innocency could not ſo wel honour all his Creators as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Fall and Re-creation.</note> 
                  <hi>Adam</hi> by his Fall and Recreation the better able to know, and honour all the three Perſons in the God-head as his Creators, for <hi>Adam</hi> could not honour all his Creators ſo well in his Innocency as after his Fall and Re-creation, and in this reſpect all the three Perſons in the God-head are called our Creators, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12. 1. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 149. 2. and our Makers, <hi>Job</hi> 35. 10. <hi>Eſ.</hi> 54. 5. and truly ſuch Creators could not reſt on the Seventh Day from all the Works which they had Created and made, until they had made man to know them to be their Creators by a Re-creation, which <hi>Adam</hi> could not do as long as he ſtood in his Innocency; but as ſoon as his Creation was finiſhed and made perfect by a Re-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then faln man both knew and honoured all his Creators; and the Mediator in ſpecial to be the Mediator of his Re-creation, of his Reconciliation, and eternal Redemption, and then God reſted on the Seventh Day, becauſe he had finiſhed his Creation by the promiſed Seed.</p>
               <p>4 After <hi>Adams</hi> fall it pleaſed God ſo to queſtion with <hi>Adam</hi> about his miſerable condition by his Fall, that he made him ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of his miſery; and then it pleaſed God to make his Mercy known to him in the Mediator. It was a terror to the Devil to
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:167973:28"/>
hear, that the Seed of the Woman ſhould break his head, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. but becauſe it was a great comfort to faln <hi>Adam,</hi> for God declared the Mediator both in his Perſon and Office to faln <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> and by Gods deſcription <hi>Adam</hi> could not chuſe but know that his Perſon muſt needs be both God and Man; he could not chuſe but know, that he that muſt break the Devils Head-plot muſt needs be God, and that he that muſt be born of the Seed of the Woman muſt needs be Man, and then for his Office hee could not chuſe but know, that it muſt be a Mediatorial office of reconciliation, or elſe ſuch a miſerable ſinner as be could never be reſtored again into Gods favour.</p>
               <p>In all theſe reſpects faln <hi>Adam</hi> could not chuſe but know, and honour the Father for his great Mercy, in propounding ſuch a Mediator; and he could not chuſe but know, and honour the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator of his Redemption more than if he had ſtood ſtill in his innocency; and he could not chuſe but know and honour the Holy Ghoſt, becauſe his heart and minde was recreated, and made new by the ſanctifying work of the Holy Ghoſt for the ſake of the Mediator, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1, 2. Fallen <hi>Adam</hi> of himſelf had no skill, nor will, to finde out a Mediator, till the Holy Ghoſt did inable him to beleeve that the Seed of the Woman ſhould one day give his Soul as a Mediatorial Sacrifice of attonement (even then when the Devil ſhould peirce him in the foot-ſoals) for the procuring of his Fathers reconciliation, by which he ſhould bee eternally redeemed from the Curſe due to his diſobedience, and from the guilt of his ſin, and ſo be received into Gods favour as his adopted ſon.</p>
               <p>O the infinite Wiſdom of God, that could tell how to aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment mans happineſſe, and his own praiſe, by <hi>Adams</hi> ſinful diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience! if <hi>Adam</hi> had continued ſtill in his innocency he ſhould have been continued only in his Natural perfections, and have been a Lord above all the reſt of the viſible Creation; but in that condition he could not have ſo much honoured all his Creators as he did after his recreation; neither ſhould he have attained to that degree of happineſs as after his Fall, by the Mediator; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could the Holy Trinity have been ſo glorious is his Soul as they were after his Fall and recreation.</p>
               <p>5 This ſentence, before <hi>the ſeventh day God had finiſhed the work that he had made,</hi> is a remarkable ſentence, full of Spiritual weight
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:167973:28"/>
and worth, becauſe it imports, that though <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> were created but mutably perfect in the former part of the ſixth day, yet that they were recreated and made perfect by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed Seed in the latter part of that day, namely before the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day, and that this finiſhing act of Gods Creation by a Recreation was the perfection of the whole Creation, ſo that nothing could be added to it afterwards, to make the Creation<note place="margin">The Creation of the Human Nature of Chriſt in the latter part of the ſixth day, was the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the whole Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> more perfect to the worlds end; for by the Creation of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature of Chriſt, of the Seed of the Woman (which muſt be created in the ſixth day) for it is a Creature, and therefore it was truly exiſting in that Prophetical declaration of it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. I ſay, this addition to the Creation in the cool of the ſixth day, made the whole Creation perfect and intire, lacking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and ſo much the word had made, and had finiſhed, muſt import; namely, it muſt import ſuch a finiſhing act and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of all the Creation, as muſt have as full and as large a<note place="margin">The Myſtical as well as the Natural Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, and made, before the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day, and therefore <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> were re-created be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſeventh day.</note> ſenſe as can be contained in the Scriptures; namely, it muſt have a Myſtical ſenſe as well as a Literal, <hi>John</hi> ſaith, Chap. 1. 3. <hi>All things were made by him,</hi> even all things without exception that were made, were made by him in ſix days, therefore we muſt not leave any ſort of Creature out of the Work of thoſe ſix days, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting him that did create them; ſo that whatever Myſtical thing is found in any part of the Scripture to be Created by God, in relation to Man, or to the Mediator, it muſt be included as a particular Commentary, or Expoſition of theſe terms, had fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, had made, had created Before the ſeventh day.</p>

                  <hi>Arius</hi> denied Chriſt to be of the ſame nature with his Father,<note place="margin">See the Sum of Divinity, by <hi>Jo. Dowuham,</hi> p. 35.

               <p>But ſeeing it is plain that God made all Creatures in ſix days, both the Son and the Spirit (if they were Creatures) muſt have been comprehended in that work. Hence I inferre, that ſeeing the Human nature of Chriſt was a Creature (and differing much from fallen man, becauſe he was conceived by the Holy Ghoſt) it muſt be comprehended in the Creation of the ſixth day; and therefore his Human nature did exiſt in that Prophetical declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:167973:29"/>
of being made of the Seed of the Woman to break the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents head.</p>

                  <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>All things were made by him,</hi> (even his own Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature) <hi>and without him was nothing made that was made,</hi> John 1. 3. and the Apoſtle makes Chriſt as Mediator to be the firſt of all things, that he might be the Head of his Body the Church, that in all things he might have the preheminence, therefore <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> muſt be Re-created in the day of their Creation, that ſo from that day forward Chriſt might be the Head of his Body the Church, that in all things he might have the prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 15. to 19. and in this reſpect alſo Chriſt is ſaid to ſave us, and to call us by a holy Calling before the world was, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 9. becauſe he was ordained to his Office before the world was.</p>
               <p>6 The very frame of the words in <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. (being delivered ſo often in the pretertence) may aſſure us, that not only the firſt natural being, or exiſting of the Creation is meant, but that the very beſt ſupernatural being thereof is alſo meant; for if the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of ſome Common gifts to Nature be called a Creation, <hi>Eze.</hi> 28. 14, 15. then the ſuper-adding of ſaving gifts to fallen man, muſt needs be eſteemed as the higheſt degree of all Gods Creation, as theſe Scriptures do teſtifie, <hi>Ier. 33. 26. Ezek. 43. 1. 7. 15. 21. Eſ. 44. 2. Epheſ. 2. 10. Pſal. 100. 3. Pſal.</hi> 102. 18. Hence it follows, that ſeeing the Heavens and the Earth were fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed after they had been made, it muſt be underſtood that they were finiſhed by the Redemption and Gubernation of the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Seed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> before the ſeventh Day, and therefore that <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> muſt neceſſarily be recreated on the ſixth day, and ſo (by the Figure <hi>Synedoche,</hi> and alſo by the figure Continent for the thing contained) they muſt be a part of the New Heavens, and of the New Earth, as well as all other re-created Souls are, <hi>Eſ. 51. 16. Eſ. 65. 17<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 18. Eſ. 66. 22. Eſ. 41. 20. Pſal. 96. 11. 2 Pet. 3. 13. Rev.</hi> 21. 1.</p>
               <p>The finiſhing act of that which God had created in the end of the ſixth day by the promiſed Seed, may well be reſembled to the finiſhing act of the Temple by <hi>Joaſh</hi> and <hi>Jehoiada,</hi> they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed faithful Work-men to repair it, after that wicked <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaliah</hi> had deſtroyed it, and then it is ſaid, That a Healing went up upon the work, 1 <hi>Chro.</hi> 24. 13. that is to ſay, the breaches and decays thereof were healed, repaired, and amended; for to
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:167973:29"/>
heal a thing is to repair it, or to make it perfect and ſound again, 2 <hi>Chro. 7. 14. Pſal. 60. 2. 2 Chro.</hi> 34. 10. and thus the Temple which had been made was re-created, finiſhed, and perfected by thoſe faithful men, <hi>ver.</hi> 14.</p>
               <p>In like ſort, after that Satan by his malicious Head-plot had ruinated, and broken down that glorious Temple-work of Gods Creation, by inticing <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> to eat the forbidden Fruit, then God laid help upon one that was able and faithful to repair it, for in the end of the ſixth day God told the Devil by way of threatning, and <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> by way of Promiſe, That the Seed of the Woman ſhould break this Head-plot of the Devil, by his Mediatorial obedience, when he ſhould make his Soul a propitiatory Sacrifice for his ſin, even at the ſame time when the Devil ſhould peirce him in the foot-ſoals as a ſinful Malefactor; now God could not declare this but by his Sons pre-conſent, contract, and Covenant, upon his undertaking Gods Attonement, or Reconciliation was procured, and the holy Spirit was procured thereby alſo for <hi>Adams</hi> re-creation, and ſo a Healing went up upon the Creation by this faithful Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and bleſſed Mediator Chriſt Jeſus, the ſtrong Rock, whoſe work is perfect, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 4. and in this reſpect the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> calls the Mediator the faithful Creator, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 19. whoſe work is perfect, but <hi>Peters</hi> Greek (Ctiſtes) is borrowed from the ſeventy, on 1 <hi>Sam. 22. &amp; Pſal.</hi> 18. 2. where the <hi>Hebrew</hi> is Rock, and there it is the attribute of the Mediator; and Chriſt told his Apoſtles, that he would build his Church upon that Rock, and that the gates of Hell ſhould not overcome it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 18.</p>
               <p>Maſter <hi>Perkins</hi> on the Creed, pag. 154. ſaith, God is called the faithful Creator, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 19. becauſe he did not leave his Works of Creation without his faithful care and providence, as Maſons and Carpenters leave their Houſes as ſoon as they are built, without any further care what becomes of them, for God is a faithful Creator, that will not let his Creation go to ruine.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee that <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> were twice Created in one day; 1. They were made perfect, but yet mutable in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part of the ſixth day (as it appeared) for preſently by the ſleight of Satan they loſt their firſt Created perfections. 2. God did Re-create them with ſupernatural perfections by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:167973:30"/>
Seed, in the end of the ſame day; and this Creation was permanent, becauſe it was a Creation of God in Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 10. and becauſe Chriſt undertook to make all perfect, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God rewarded Chriſt for this his work, for at the ſame time the Lord put the whole Creation in ſubjection under the feet of Chriſt; and when all this was done, then the whole Creation was perfect, and intire, lacking nothing, and therefore Gods reſt on the Seventh Day was a perfect reſt; But if God had kept his reſt on the Seventh day whiles <hi>Adam</hi> had ſtood in his mutable condition, as ſome Expoſitors would have him to do, then Gods reſt (eſpecially on the firſt Sabbath) had ſtood but upon a tick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh and litigious foundation.</p>

               <p>Therefore that God might make his Free grace glorious to fallen Man, and that he might make the Mediator glorious to the Souls of the Elect, he made <hi>Adam</hi> at the firſt but mutably perfect, that ſo he might fall, and that ſo he might take occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereby to convince him, and humble him in the fight of his ſin and miſery, and that ſo he might take occaſion thereby to reveal unto his Soul the way of eternal Salvation by the Seed of the Woman.</p>
               <p>And for the more ſpeedy effecting of all this, he did by his eternal Counſel and Providence appoint his heavenly Angels, as wel as his terreſtrial Creatures, to attend upon <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> into Paradiſe, for he fore-knew that if he did but give his heavenly Angels charge to attend upon earthly Man, with other earthly Creatures into Paradiſe, that many Legions of them would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe Man in compariſon of themſelves, and would neglect their charge, that ſo in Juſtice God might deprive them of their pure Natural qualities, and then he knew that they would become an envious company againſt the glory of Man, and that they would agree together in one deep Head-plot (altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen to Man) to ſeduce him, and perſwade him to eat of the forbidden Fruit, that ſo they might be brought into the ſame Spiritual death with themſelves; and by this ſpeedy Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plot of theirs they made account not only to corrupt <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> but alſo to deſtroy the whole Generation of all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
               <p>But God that was wiſe in Counſel, and wonderful in Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, who worketh all things after the Counſel of his own Wil, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 11. had contrived how to break this Head-plot of the Devil in peeces by the Seed of the Woman; this Divine Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plot the Angels that fell knew not of, for if they had but known it, then they would not have refuſed to attend upon <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> into Paradiſe; and thus God by his eternal Counſel and Providence had contrived how to make this Head-plot of the Devil to be an occaſion to declare his goodneſs to fallen Man, both the goodneſs of Juſtice, and the goodneſs of Mercy, by making the Perſon and office of the Mediator better known, and more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired and honoured of fallen Man, than if <hi>Adam</hi> had ſtood ſtill in his innocency.</p>

                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:167973:31"/>As ſoon therefore as <hi>Adam</hi> was fallen, God took occaſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to introduce the Mediator into his Prieſtly Office virtually, that ſo he might reconcile and redeem Man, and put him into a better eſtate again than he had by his firſt Creation, and that thereby God might put all the reſt of his Creation under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Chriſt, as the true Lord, and proper Heir of all things, for all things were created for him, <hi>Col.</hi> I. 16. or elſe if he had not reſtrained ſin, and been pre-ordained to bee the Heir of all things, and to be ready at hand to take the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of all upon him at <hi>Adams</hi> Fall, the whole Creation had been inſtantly confounded by a general Rebellion, and by a total Diſorder, which was the main thing that the Devil aimed at in his Head-plot, but it was prevented, becauſe he had ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Chriſt to be the right Heir of all, to undertake the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all at the very inſtant of <hi>Adams</hi> Fall, and ſo his Mercy is over all his Works, as the Hen is over her Chickens, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 145.</p>

               <p>2 The humane nature of Chriſt was created, and exhibited in a gracious declaration of <hi>Adams</hi> redemption (from the Devils Head-plot by the ſeed of the Woman) as the perfection of all the Creation on the ſixth day, his humane nature is a creature, and therefore it was virtually made fleſh of the ſeed of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, before it could be ſaid, <hi>That God had finiſhed all his works which he had created and made;</hi> and ther<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Chriſt was as truly made fleſh of the ſeed of the Virgin <hi>Eve</hi> on the ſixth day, as he was made fleſh of the ſeed of <hi>David, Rom.</hi> 1. 3.
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:167973:32"/>
and his fleſh was as truly eaten by faith of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> and of all the godly Fathers that offered Sacrifices of Attonement by faith, as it is eaten by us now; for this Propoſition is general, and belongeth to the godly in all ages from the firſt Promiſe, <hi>That un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe ye eat the fleſh of the Son of Man, ye can have no life in you,</hi> Joh. 6. 53. And for the confirmation of this firſt Promiſe (that Chriſt ſhould be made fleſh of the ſeed of the woman) Chriſt did often appear to the Fathers in the ſhape of a man, <hi>Gen. 32. 24. Prov.</hi> 8. 31. to aſſure them, that as he was truly exhibited in a gracious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to our firſt Parents, ſo he would in due time take our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon him; and in this reſpect the humane nature of Chriſt was called by the Prophet <hi>Jeremy, A new created thing in the Earth, A Virgin ſhall compaſſe a man,</hi> Jer. 31. 22.</p>
               <p>This whole Chapter is a Propheſie of the dayes of the Meſſiah (as any conſiderate Reader may eaſily diſcern) I put in the term Virgin, inſtead of our tranſlated term Woman, and yet I find no fault with the term Woman, provided the interpretation be of a Virgin-Woman; but if the term Woman be taken for one that hath a Husband, in that ſenſe I diſlike the term, for it is no new cre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ted thing for a woman that hath a husband to compaſſe a man-child in her womb.</p>
               <p>2 I diſſent from them that think the word Compaſſe doth mean the crafty fetches of an immodeſt woman, ſeeking as an agent to circumvent ſome man or other into the bond of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; This Interpretation cannot ſtand, becauſe this is no new created thing.</p>
               <p>3 I diſſent from them that make this Woman to be the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the <hi>Jews</hi> that ſhall conquer the great Empire of the <hi>Turks,</hi> for this new device doth not make this new created thing.</p>
               <p>But to me it is moſt evident that this new created thing is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but the humane nature of Chriſt encompaſſed in the womb of a Virgin; Firſt, of the Virgin <hi>Eve;</hi> And ſecondly, of the Virgin <hi>Mary:</hi> And at this new created thing, no doubt but <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> did as much wonder, as the Angels did at the hanging of the earth upon nothing, <hi>Job</hi> 38. 7. yea this new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thing may juſtly raviſh both Men and Angels with wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as it doth, 1 <hi>Tim. 3. 16. 1 Pet. 1. 12. Exod.</hi> 25. 20.</p>
               <p>By this Viſion the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> did call backſliding <hi>Iſrael</hi> to conſider this new created thing (ſaying, by way of wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:167973:33"/>
at their unbeleef) <hi>How long wilt thou ga about, O thou back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliding daughter? for the Lord hath created a new thing in the earth, A Vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin-woman ſhall compaſſe a man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence it is evident, that if this backſliding Daughter had but duly conſidered this new created thing, it would have wrought true converſion in them as well as it did in <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve (But who hath beleeved our report,</hi> ſaith the Prophet in the like caſe, <hi>Eſ. 53. 1. Iſaiah</hi> would have cured wicked <hi>Ahaz</hi> his unbeleef with this ſign, <hi>Eſ.</hi> 7. 14, but this new created thing did not work admiration in his affections, as it did in <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> and therefore it did him no good.</p>
               <p>After <hi>Jeremy</hi> had propounded this new created thing for the converſion of back-ſliding <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>I awaked, and behold my ſleep was ſweet unto me,</hi> Jer. 31. 26. it wrought ſweet affections of joy in the conſideration of it; But if <hi>Jeremy</hi> had conceived as ſome Interpreters do, that this woman had been a ſubtill immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt woman, then I marvell how he could have had any ſweet content in that conſideration when he awoke.</p>
               <p>By this woman therefore I do not only underſtand the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> that did actually compaſſe the Humane nature of Chriſt in her womb, but I do alſo underſtand the Virgin <hi>Eve</hi> that did virtually compaſſe him in her womb by faith, for God did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit the Meſſiah to her in a gracious Propoſition in the cool of the ſixth day while ſhe was a Virgin; And it is remarkable that the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> doth ſpeak of this new created thing both in the time paſt, and alſo in the time to come; <hi>Behold,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the Lord hath created a new thing in the earth</hi> (and in the next clauſe he ſpeaks of it as of a thing to come) <hi>A Virgin ſhall compaſſe a man, or a man-child</hi> (for a man-child is called <hi>A man,</hi> Job 3. 2. Joh. 16. 21.)</p>
               <p>So then this phraſe, <hi>Ged had finiſhed his work which he had made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſeventh day,</hi> includes all this that I have ſpoken of the Humane nature of Chriſt, as I have alſo noted it in Chap. 3. R. 2.</p>
               <p>Alſo the extent of this term <hi>created</hi> and <hi>made</hi> is very large, for it is often applied to things that are new, marvellous, and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, <hi>Eſ. 65. 18. Ex. 34. 10. Num.</hi> 16. 30. alſo it is applied to Gods powerfull acts, <hi>Deut</hi> 3 24. and to things that are done in a mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous manner above nature, <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 9. In all which regards
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:167973:33"/>
the humane nature of Chriſt, (as it was compaſſed in the womb of a Virgin that never knew man) may well be called a glorious, powerful, and miraculous new created thing in the earth to the ſound converſion of a true conſiderate heart.</p>
               <p>2 This new created thing the Prophet <hi>Agur</hi> doth make to be the greateſt wonder of all the four which he doth name, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare together, in <hi>Prov.</hi> 30. 18, 19.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Three things</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>are too wonderful for me, yea four that I know not; 1 The way of an Eagle in the air. 2 The way of a Serpent from a Rock. 3 The way of a ſhip in the midſt of the Sea.</hi> And 4 <hi>The way of a man in a Virgin.</hi> The <hi>Hebrew</hi> word which is tranſlated Woman in this place, doth properly ſignifie ſuch a woman as never knew man by carnal generation. This <hi>Hebrew</hi> word is never uſed for a polluted Adultreſſe as ſome would have it to mean in this place. 2 Neither is this <hi>Hebrew</hi> word uſed for a maried woman, but alwayes for a Virgin that never knew man: Examine the ſeveral places where this <hi>Hebrew</hi> word is uſed, and that will confirm the truth of my obſervation; It is uſed but ſix times only in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Gen. 24. 43 Pſ. 68. 25. Cant. 1. 2. Cant. 6. 7. Eſ. 7. 14. Prov.</hi> 30. 19. in the firſt five places no queſtion is made by any to the contrary; all the queſtion is about this laſt place in <hi>Prov.</hi> 30. 19. and yet if the ſcope of the Prophet <hi>Agur</hi> in this Chapter be well marked, there is no more queſtion of this place, than of the reſt; for in this Chapter the Prophet <hi>Agur</hi> doth ſpeak of Chriſt in our nature, and calls him <hi>Ithiel</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>call,</hi> verſ. 1. Mr. <hi>Broughton</hi> in <hi>Eccleſiaſtes,</hi> pag. 11. ſaith, that <hi>Agur</hi> ſpeaks of Gods dwelling in Chriſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Ithiel</hi> and <hi>

               <p>Therefore ſeeing the Prophet <hi>Agur</hi> doth ſpeak of Chriſt in our nature in the fore-front of this Propheſie, what lets but that he may ſpeak alſo of his wonderful ſtrange conception in the womb of a Virgin? the wonderfulneſſe whereof he doth illuſtrate by way of compariſon to three other things that are beyond the power of humane reaſon to find out; For firſt, who can find out the path-way where a ſhip hath gone in the middeſt of the Sea? Or ſecondly, the path-way where an Eagle hath flown in the midſt of the air? Or thirdly, the path-way of a Serpent from

the Rock: Put fourthly, who can find out how a Man child can be conceived in the womb of a Virgin that never knew man? the Prophet <hi>Agur</hi> makes this fourth thing a greater wonder than the other three. And this laſt the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> calls a new created thing in the earth; and ſeeing all ſorts of creatures were created in ſix dayes, it follows, that this new created thing of the humane nature of Chriſt in the womb of a Virgin, was created and exhibited to fallen <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> in a gracious Propetical D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But God could not be ſaid to keep a perfect reſt from all his Works which he had made, as long as <hi>Adam</hi> ſtood in a mutable condition, for God knew from Eternity that <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> would preſently fall from their Created perfections, through the temptation of Satan, and that thereupon the whole Creation would fall into utter confuſion, and that then God muſt either ſuffer Satan to take the Dominion of the whole Creation, or elſe that he muſt begin again to make it more perfect than it was before, by a new Creation.</p>
               <p>Seeing therfore that one of theſe two things muſt neceſſarily follow upon <hi>Adams</hi> fall, God could not keep a perfect reſt on the Seventh Day from all his Works, untill he had inſtalled the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator into his Office, and ſetled the whole government of all things upon his ſhoulders, as upon our mighty God and Prince of peace, <hi>Eſ.</hi> 9. 6, 7.</p>

               <p>Firſt, It muſt be remembred, That Gods reſt on the ſeventh day was not a Natural reſt, after the labour of his ſix Days Work; for the Creator of all the ends of the earth fainteth not, neither is weary, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 40. 28.</p>

               <p>Thirdly, Neither was Gods reſt upon the ſeventh day a bare contemplation of his viſible Creation, as others would have it, thinking thereby to warrant their pleaſant Re-creations, and Contemplations upon the Lords Day, by walking out into the Fields to be hold the Works of God, and to behold his eternal Power and God head in the Creation; this is not the true reſt of the Sabbath, for ſuch duties as theſe a Heathen Philoſopher

               <p>As ſoon as God had thus renewed the face of the earth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104. 30. and ſetled the government of all his Works upon the Perſon and Office of the Mediator, then God reſted on the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day, with infinite content, and ſweet ſatisfaction, rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing in the Works of his hands, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104. 31. but the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth verſe makes Gods Creation to be Spiritual as well as earthly, and ſo doth <hi>Pſal. 100. 3. Pſal. 102. 18. Eſ. 54. 5. Eſ.</hi> 65. 18.</p>
               <p>This ſweet ſatisfying reſt which God took in ſetling all the works of his hands upon the Mediator, is thus expreſſed by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> In ſix days Jehovah made the Heavens and the Earth, and in the ſeventh day he reſted, and was refreſhed, <hi>Exod.</hi> 31. 17. Gods reſting was not from his wearineſſe of labour in the work of Creation, but from the heavie burden of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, which had ſpoiled all his Creation till he had re-created <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſetled him and all the reſt of the Creation upon the Rock Chriſt, and in this reſpect God doth often complain of Mans ſin as a heavie burden to his Soul, <hi>Amos 5. 2, 13, Eſ.</hi> 1. 14. And as the ſin of the old, World did grieve God to the heart, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 6. ſo no doubt but <hi>Adams</hi> ſin above any other ſin did grieve him to his heart, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till God had re-created <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> by the promiſed Seed, and put the whole Creation under his government, and then God reſted the ſeventh day, and was refreſhed; that is to ſay, the grief of his heart which fell upon him in the ſixth day by reaſon of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, was removed from him, by the Mediators under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking to make a reconciliation by his propitiatory Sacrifice of Attonement in the cool of the ſixth day, and from that day for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God inſtructed <hi>Adam</hi> how to offer Sacrifices of Attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:167973:37"/>
as a lively memorial thereof; and thenceforth all Sacrifices of Attonement are called ſacrifices of reſt to Jehovah, and ſweet ſacrifices of reſt, <hi>Gen.</hi> 8. 21. becauſe Chriſts Sacrifice doth quiet and pacifie Gods Soul, that was ſo exceedingly diſpleaſed and grieved for <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, and therefore the Seventy call ſacrifices of reſt ſweet Sacrifices, which phraſe of theirs <hi>Paul</hi> doth approve and uſe, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 2. they are alſo called ſacrifices of Attonement, or propitiatory Sacrifices.</p>
               <p>Upon this new ſettlement of the Creation upon the Mediator,<note place="margin">All the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty reſted, and were refreſhed on the ſeventh day, becauſe they had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected mans happineſs by a Re-creation.</note> God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghoſt were refreſhed; now all the bleſſed Trinity, our bleſſed Creators and Makers, did rejoyce in the works of their hands.</p>
               <p n="1">1 The Father was refreſhed with great joy of heart, becauſe he had found out a Reconciler, and becauſe his loſt Son was found again, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The Son rejoyced, and was refreſhed, becauſe he had taken upon him the Perſon and Office of a Mediator, that ſo hee might ſeek and ſave that which was loſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 11, 12, 13, 14.</p>
               <p n="3">3 The Holy Ghoſt rejoyced, and was refreſhed, becauſe hee had re-created the heart of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> and filled their Souls with joy unſpeakable, and glorious, by inabling them to beleeve in the promiſed Seed, as the Procurator of the Fathers Attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by his propitiatory ſacrifice.</p>
               <p>And truly this work of Re-creation muſt needs be a ground of perfect reſt, and of joyful refreſhing to ſuch bleſſed Creators, that could tell how to finde out ſuch a myſterious way to create a-new that glorious work, that was ſo confounded and ſpoyled by Satans Head-plot.</p>
               <p>The Angels alſo rejoyced at the converſion of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> ſaying, Glory to God in the higheſt, and on the earth peace, and good will towards men, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. 14. and this muſt needs bee ſo, becauſe they rejoyce at the converſion of every ſinner that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penteth, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15. 7.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> did alſo keep a bleſſed reſt upon the Sabbath; for their Souls were rejoyced and refreſhed, becauſe they did by faith reſt on the Seed of the Woman for the breaking of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils Head-plot.</p>
               <p>And thus the firſt ſeventh day was a joyful day of reſt, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing,

               </p>
               <p>And it is further evident that Gods reſt on the ſeventh day, was nothing elſe but the quieting of his mind in Chriſts Sacrifice of Attonement, becauſe God is ſaid to reſt in ſeveral types of Chriſt as well as in the ſeventh day, in relation to his reſting on the Mediator for mans Redemption from Sathans Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plot.</p>

               <p>But no man, I think, will ſay, that God did reſt in any of theſe things otherwiſe than as they were types of the Mediators Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Sacrifice, wherein onely Gods ſoul doth reſt as in the onely Mediatorial procuring cauſe of his Attonement for mans Redemption from Sathans Head-plot.</p>

               <p>THis ſentence, <hi>God bleſſed the ſeventh day, and ſanctified it,</hi> Gen. 2. 3. doth contain in it a full deſcription how God did bleſſe the ſeventh day for the good of faln man.</p>

               <p>1 It is meet to inquire how God did bleſſe the firſt ſeventh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> day; Did he bleſſe it with any natural bleſſing above the othe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Hath he beſtowed a greater bleſſing of fairer Weather, or the like, upon that daymore than upon any other day in the week? no, but on the contrary he reſtrained his Manna from falling on that day, and beſtowed it upon the <hi>Jews</hi> on all the other ſix dayes of the week.</p>
               <p>Therefore the bleſſing wherewith God did bleſſe the ſeventh day was not a common natural bleſſing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but doubtleſſe it was a ſpiritual bleſſing in relation to the good of faln man. Hence then

               <p>It is a dangerous thing therefore to prefer a mans own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate meditations, and ſpeculations, to publick Ordinances upon the Sabbath; God would not leave <hi>Adam</hi> to ſuch a liberty to do as he thought beſt, ſuch a liberty will ſoon open a wide gap to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans deluſions: But God bleſſed the ſeventh day with his own publick Ordinances, not excluding private meditations; God bleſſed the ſeventh day both with publick and private Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; for publick Ordinances are not ſo much bleſſed as when they are attended with private preparation before, with reverent at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention at, and with carefull rumination and application after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If there be not this care added to the publick Ordinances, the Devill will ſoon ſteal away the ſeed that is ſown, out of our hearts and ſouls.</p>
               <p>Now the manner how God was pleaſed to inſtruct <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> in the exerciſe of his publick Ordinances, was by the lively Oracles of the Mediator, and therefore doubtleſſe as he was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to be the Seed of the woman, ſo he appeared to <hi>Adam</hi> in his humane ſhape, as he did to <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 32. 24.

               <p>Now the ſeveral Ordinances wherewith God was pleaſed to bleſſe the ſeventh day, I will diſtinguiſh into two ſorts, or ranks.</p>

               <p>1 I will ſpeak of the plain and manifeſt Ordinances; Theſe were often uſed without the typical, but the typical could not well be uſed without ſome of theſe were added thereto; By theſe plain and manifeſt Ordinances God appointed <hi>Adam</hi> as a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, by the exerciſe of them, to inſtruct himſelf, his wife, and poſterity, by opening the miſery of his fall, and the remedy by the Promiſed Seed.</p>

               <p n="2">2 <hi>Adam</hi> muſt preach, open, and declare to himſelf, and his wife (till they were increaſed in number) the riches of Gods grace for his recovery by the Seed of the Woman, which God had ordained to break the Devils Head-plot for their Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and in opening this, he could not chooſe but open and declare the perſonal union of both the natures of the Mediator, and the excellent dignity of his Office.</p>
               <p>This bleſſed Doctrine <hi>Adam</hi> was commanded to ſtudy to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain and inlarge (every ſeventh day) in all the branches thereof, and in all the ſeveral benefits thereof to faln man, according to the full extent of Gods Declaration in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. and therefore he muſt open and explain how Chriſt ſhould be the Seed of the Woman, and how he ſhould break the Devils Head-plot by his Prieſtly Office, and by his Propitiatory Sacrifice of Attonement, at the very ſametime when the Devill ſhould endeavour to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it, by putting him to death, and by peircing his foot-ſoals as a ſinfull Malefactor upon the Croſſe; and how he being God as well as man, ſhould deſtroy through death him that had the power of death, that is the Devill, and how he ſhould by that death (which he performed as a Mediatorial Sacrifice) reconcile God to faln man, and ſo procure the Fathers Juſtification from the ſentence of Condemnation, and his favor for their adoption, and for their injoying of his heavenly inheritance.</p>
               <p>Theſe and ſuch like points as theſe, God inſtructed <hi>Adam</hi>

               <p>Theſe ſeveral ſorts of Ordinances I call by the name of plain and manifeſt Ordinances, becauſe they often were and might be uſed without any addition of Typical ſacrifices, or ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of cleaneſs.</p>
               <p>And this is evident by Gods Command afterwards to the<note place="margin">See my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Jews</hi> Synagogues or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der on this text.</note> Church of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 23. 3. The ſeventh day ſhall be a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath of Sabbatiſm, a Convocation of Holineſs; it ſhall be a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath to Jehovah in all your dwellings.</p>
               <p>This ſentence [in All your dwellings] proves that God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to obſerve the Sabbath, not only at the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle where Sacrifices muſt be only offered, but it muſt be kept in all their dwellings where no Sacrifices might be offered, and yet by dwellings we muſt not underſtand every mans private Tent, for God commands a Convocation of Holineſs, and a Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation agrees not to every mans private Tent; therefore the meaning of theſe words, <hi>A Convocation in all your dwellings</hi> means
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:167973:41"/>
a Convocation of Holineſs in all their ſeveral Synagogues, which were to be conveniently placed in or among all their dwellings, both during the time of their abode in the Wilderneſs, and alſo where-ever they dwelt afterwards.</p>
               <p>This commanded convocation was not given to the <hi>Jews</hi> in regard of their Feſtival Sabbaths, which were obſerved with the ſolemnity of Sacrifices, and other rites of Holineſs, for their Feſtival Sabbaths were commanded to be obſerved only in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> at the particular place that God ſhould chuſe to place his Tabernacle or Temple in, after they ſhould be ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in reſt therein; and indeed they could not obſerve their feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val Sabbaths in the Wilderneſs, neither could they every ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day offer Sacrifices in the Wilderneſs, for during the time of their travels in the Wilderneſs the Holy things were folded up.</p>
               <p>But yet notwithſtanding their travels in the Wilderneſs, they were commanded to obſerve every ſeventh day wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And it is evident, that the <hi>Jews</hi> did obſerve the Sabbath with Holy convocations in all their Synagogues, becauſe our Saviour did uſually preach every ſeventh day in their Synagogues, either in <hi>Galile,</hi> or in <hi>Judea,</hi> where none of <hi>Aarons</hi> Ceremonies had any uſe at all.</p>
               <p>By this command of God to the <hi>Jews,</hi> it is manifeſt, That God commanded <hi>Adam</hi> to obſerve every ſeventh day with his plain and manifeſt Ordinances, and doubtleſſe oftentimes alſo with his Typiral and Myſtical Ordinances, which at the firſt were not tied to one ſpecial place.</p>
               <p>2 The ſecond ſort of Gods publick Ordinances were Typical, and Myſtical, the chiefeſt of all this kind of Worſhip was by propitiatory Sacrifices, or Sacrifices of Attonement, which were of ſeveral ſorts.</p>

               <p>All theſe ſeveral ſorts of Sacrifices did typifie and repreſent the

Mediators Propitiatory Sacrifice of Attonement, by which he procured the Fathers Attonement for faln mans Reconciliation, Juſtification, and Adoption, and ſo conſequently for mans Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption from Sathans Head-plot.</p>
               <p>This bleſſed Doctrine of Salvation, Chriſt repreſented to <hi>Adams</hi> faith in the very firſt ſeventh day, by cauſing <hi>Adam</hi> as a Prieſt to ſacrifice ſome Lamb, or ſome ſuch like beaſt, and then doubtleſſe he ſaid unto him, <hi>Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the ſin of the world,</hi> Joh. 1. 29. for Chriſt was typically ſlain from the beginning of the world, <hi>Rev.</hi> 8. 13.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adam</hi> of himſelf could not tell how to offer ſacrifice, and<note place="margin">Chriſt Jeſus taught <hi>Adam</hi> by the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a Lamb how he ſhould be the Lamb of God to take away the ſin of the world.</note> therefore doubtleſſe Jeſus Chriſt appeared to him in the ſhape of his humane nature, and did inſtruct him by a lively Oracle, what the Office of a Prieſt was, and how to build an Altar of earth (for that kind of Altar was firſt in uſe, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20 24.) and that all thoſe places where ſuch Altars were builded, were holy places, as long as ſuch places were in uſe for ſacrifice, and therefore Chriſt Jeſus did uſually ſanctifie ſuch places, either by his glorious apparition, or by fire from heaven to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>conſume the Sacrifice, or by both.</p>
               <p>The Altar was holy in another reſpect, namely becauſe it was ordained to be a type of the God-head of Chriſt, whereon he would one day offer his humane nature, as a ſacrifice of Attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Exod. 29. 37. Mat. 23. 19. Heb.</hi> 9. 14.</p>
               <p>And doubtleſſe Chriſt Jeſus did kindle <hi>Adams</hi> ſacrifice at firſt with fire from heaven, for he did uſually kindle the ſacrifices of the Fathers with fire from Heaven, as a ſign and token to them, that his death was a propitiatory ſacrifice of Attonement, and that their perſons were thereby received into full favour, <hi>Lev. 9. 23. Judg. 13. 19, 20, 23. 1 King. 18. 38, 39. 2 Chron. 7. 1, 2, 3. Pſal.</hi> 20. 3.</p>
               <p>And doubtleſſe Chriſt Jeſus told <hi>Adam</hi> that this fire from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven did repreſent his Eternal Spirit, by which his humane nature ſhould one day be offered up unto God without ſpot, as a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiatory ſacrifice for his eternal Redemption, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14.</p>
               <p>But after wards when <hi>Cain</hi> came to offer his ſacrifice upon the ſame Altar, Chriſt Jeſus did not kindle his ſacrifice from heaven as he kindled <hi>Adams</hi> and <hi>Abels</hi> ſacrifice; and by that <hi>Cain</hi> knew that God did not accept his perſon, as he did his brother <hi>Abel,</hi>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:167973:42"/>
and thereupon he hated his brother <hi>Abel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> becauſe his works were good, and his own evill, for <hi>Cain</hi> wanted ſaith in the Seed of the woman, which was promiſed to break the Devils Head-plot by his propitiatory ſacrifice, which was taught, and typified by ſacrifices: This myſtery God kept ſecret in types from ſuch as wanted faith, even from the beginning of the world, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 25. and therefore it was kept ſecret from the Heathen Nations: But in the fulneſſe of time Chriſt Jeſus ſent his Apoſtles to publiſh the unſearchable riches of this myſtery, which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God who created all things by Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Eph. 3. 8 9. Col. 1. 26. Col.</hi> 2. 3.</p>
               <p>3 God inſtructed <hi>Adam</hi> in ſundry other kinds of Ceremonial types that tended to ſanctification, before he came to preſent his perſon and ſacrifice before the Lord. As for example, Chriſt Jeſus taught him, 1 How to purifie his perſon by waſhing his body, and his garments, in clean water, juſt like as he taught <hi>Moſes</hi> afterwards, <hi>Exod. 3. 5.

Now all that <hi>Joſhua</hi> did, to ſanctifie the people, was no more but to warn them by a Proclamation through the Camp (which uſually was attended with the ſound of a Trumpet) ſaying, <hi>Sanctifie your ſelves,</hi> it is as much as if he had ſaid, God hath commanded you to ſanctifie your ſelves; Firſt, Outwardly, by waſhing; And ſecondly, by inward repentance, againſt you come into his preſence on the morrow.</p>
               <p>So when God commanded <hi>Moſes</hi> to ſanctifie the people to hear the Law delivered at Mount <hi>Sinai, Moſes</hi> did no otherwiſe ſanctifie them but by commanding the people to prepare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in a ſanctified manner; Firſt, By inward fear and reverence; And ſecondly, by outward waſhing, and by abſtinence from their

               <p>From theſe, and ſuch like inſtances, it follows, That when God ſanctified the firſt ſeventh day, he commanded <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> (for the more ſolemnity) to prepare themſelves for the ſanctifying of the ſeventh day; God having made a promiſe to them in the end of the ſixth day, that the Seed of the Woman ſhould break the head of the Serpent, he ſanctified the next day for a Sabbath of reſt, becauſe he had bleſſed it with Ordinances, and thereby he did command <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> to prepare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt they came into his holy preſence on the morrow, for ſin had deſiled them, and therefore they needed to prepare themſelves, not onely by outward waſhing, but alſo inwardly by true repentance, <hi>Act. 22. 16. 1 Pet. 3. 15. Eſ.</hi> 29. 23. or elſe inſtead of receiving good by that bleſſing wherewith God had bleſſed the ſeventh day, they might expect a curſe, at leaſt an outward curſe upon their bodies, as it fell out upon <hi>Aarons</hi> Sons, when they did not ſanctifie the Lord in his worſhip according to his command, the Lord ſtruck them with preſent death, ſaying, <hi>I will be ſanctified in all that come neer me,</hi> Lev. 10. 3. and when ſome of <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Manaſſes</hi> did come to the ſanctified Paſſeover in the dayes of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> God was diſpleaſed with them, becauſe they had not prepared themſelves thereto according to the ſanctified, or commanded preparation of the Sanctuary; but <hi>Hezekiah</hi> prayed for them, and the Lord heard him, and healed the people, 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 30, 18, 19, 20.</p>
               <p>2 I will ſpeak a little more of the word <hi>Sanctified,</hi> as it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies a command to fallen man to prepare himſelf to ſanctify the ſeventh day, for all ſanctified things muſt be remembred by way of preparation before hand, that ſo they may be done in due time and order, or elſe God that is jealous of his ſanctified things, will be diſpleaſed.</p>
               <p>And therefore one Reaſon why the word <hi>Remember</hi> was after added to the fourth Commadement was (not to adde a new ſenſe to that Command more than it had to <hi>Adam</hi> under the word <hi>Sanctified</hi>) but to increaſe the charge of preparation, with more vehemency, which at the firſt was co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Lord,</hi> Exod. 16. 23. Chriſt Jeſus did not now ſpeak theſe words to them by way of a firſt Inſtitution of the Sabbath, but by way of admonition to prepare themſelves to obſerve it as a holy or ſanctified day already commanded; for how elſe did the ſeventh day come to be now called the Holy Sabbath, but by a former command? for every holy thing is firſt commanded of God; and therefore that they might the better remember the holy Sabbath to ſanctifie it, Chriſt Jeſus reſtrained the falling of Manna, ſo that there was no Manna rained upon that day, as there was upon all the other ſix dayes; by which wonder God did charge the people to remember the Sabbath day, and to prepare themſelves for it by preparing the food of the Sabbath on the ſixth day; and yet for all this, it came to paſſe, that there went out ſome of the people to gather (Manna) and they found none; thereupon the Lord Jeſus ſaid thus unto <hi>Moſes, How long refuſe you to keep my Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and my Laws,</hi> Exod. 16. 27, 28.

               <p>From all theſe conſiderations it is evident, that Jeſus Chriſt hath ever been uniform in his command touching the ſanctified uſe of the ſeventh day, even from the very firſt inſtitution of it, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 3. untill he had finiſhed the typical reſt of it by his

               <p>But God Reſted the ſeventh day, and ſanctified that day of Reſt, becauſe his ſoul did now reſt upon the Rock Chriſt, who had undertaken mans Re-creation, and the government of the whole Creation in oppoſition to Sathans Head-plot, then Gods Soul reſted on the ſeventh day, and was refreſhed: If God had reſted on the ſeventh day whiles <hi>Adam</hi> ſtood in a mutable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, his reſt had been but an imperfect and uncertain reſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of <hi>Adams</hi> ſpeedy fall, God did not therefore reſt, nor ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie that reſt as a typical ſign of his reſt, and of mans reſt in the Seed

               <p>And this anſwer to the aboveſaid Objection is the rather to be credited, becauſe the Redemption from <hi>Aegypt</hi> by the typical blood of the Lamb, is alleged by Chriſt as the general reaſon to inforce his people to the obſervation of all the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for the Angel of the Covenant ſaith thus in <hi>Exod. 20. 2.

               <p>Seven dayes were appointed for the conſecration of the Prieſts into their Prieſtly office, <hi>Exod.</hi> 29. 30. in all which ſeven dayes they muſt abide at the door of the Tabernacle night and day, to keep the watches of the Lord, that no defilement might befall them, or the Sanctuary, <hi>Lev.</hi> 8. 33, 35.</p>
               <p>And the chief reaſon why their Conſecration muſt laſt ſeven dayes, was becauſe the Sabbath (which was ordained as a typical ſign of our ſanctification by Chriſt) <hi>might paſſe</hi> over them in that ſpace; and therefore the <hi>Hebrew Doctors</hi> ſay of this action, <hi>Great is the Sabbath, for the High Prieſt entreth not upon his ſervice after he is anointed, untill the Sabbath do paſſe over him.</hi>

As a ſanctified ſign; in this laſt reſpect the ſeventh day is aboliſhed by the death of Chriſt; but in the firſt reſpect, namely as it was ſet apart for ſo much time to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the exerciſe of ſuch Ordinances both publick and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, as God had bleſſed the ſeventh day withall, ſo it muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, namely, the ſeventh part of time according to the days of the Week, in a conſtant ſucceſſion to the firſt ſeventh day to the end of the world.</p>
               <p>And indeed the ſeventh part of time cannot bee tranſlated to any other day of the Week, but to the next day after the ſeventh day; for if it had been tranſlated to any other day, God ſhould have been a loſer of his ſeventh part of ſanctified time, there would have been a <hi>vacuum</hi> in the revolution of the ſeventh part of time, at leaſt in the firſt tranſlation of it to any other day but the firſt day of the Week, and ſo the roundneſſe of the ſeventh part of time would have been ſpoiled, which muſt not be admitted; for as God did not allow leſſe than ſix parts of the Week for Mans civil imployments, ſo neither will he have leſſe time for his publick worſhip than he appointed at firſt.</p>
               <p>Therefore it would have been a great diſhonour to Chriſt, who is made of God to be both the Lord of his Church, and the Lord of the Sabbath, if he had left the day of his publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip arbitrary to each particular Church, to transferre it to what day they pleaſed; A man may with as good reaſon affirm, That Chriſt hath left the outward Form of his publick Worſhip arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to each particular Church, as affirm, That he hath left the day of his publick Worſhip arbitrary; there is as much reaſon for the one as for the other; for Jeſus Chriſt by his death hath made as much alteration in the ſecond Commandement, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of his outward Worſhip, as in the fourth Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in reſpect of the change of the day.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the very order of the Ten Commandements doth plainly tell us, that all Gods publick Worſhip (which is fully comprehended in the ſecond Commandement) muſt have a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick day appointed by God himſelf, for the conſtant exerciſe of his ſaid publick Worſhip; and conſequently it follows, that as
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:167973:57"/>
ſoon as Chriſt had aboliſhed the ſeventh day by his death, he being the Lord of his Church, and the Lord of the Sabbath, muſt eſtabliſh another certain day in the place of the ſeventh day to the end of the world, without any intermiſſion or loſſe of time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The order of the four Commandements of the firſt Table, lyes thus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1 The firſt Commandement doth injoyn us to worſhip the true God alone, in Unity and Trinity, with the whole inward man.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The ſecond Commandement doth injoyn us to worſhip the true God with all ſuch outward worſhip as he had commanded at that preſent, or ſhould command afterwards.</p>
               <p n="3">3 The third Commandement doth injoyn us to worſhip God in a holy manner, both publickly and privately, and with out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward reverence, as well as inward.</p>
               <p n="4">4 The fourth Commandement doth injoyn us to obſerve the ſeventh day, not onely as a ſanctified ſign, but alſo as the ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied time of that worſhip wherewith God had bleſſed the ſeventh day; as ſoon therefore as Chriſt the Seed of the Woman had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed that work of breaking the Devills Head<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> plot<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by his Propitiatory Sacrifice, the ſeventh day, in regard it was a ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified ſign, muſt ceaſe; but as it was the ſanctified time of Gods publick worſhip, ſo it muſt not ceaſe, but it muſt ſtill be continued, or elſe Gods publick worſhip muſt ſuffer loſſe and confuſion, no other way can be found out, by which the conſtant ſolemnity of Gods eſtabliſhed worſhip may be continued, but by tranſlating the ſeventh day to the next day; for by that means onely, God ſhall ſtill have the ſeventh part of time for his publick worſhip, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out interruption; and by this means onely the twofold manner of ſanctifying the ſeventh day, doth attain its ſeverall ends.</p>
               <p>2 Let it be a little further inquired into, To what end did God command all his publick worſhip in the ſecond Command? and to what end did he command all his publick worſhip to be reverently performed in the third Command, if the day of his publick worſhip in the fourth Command be wholly obliturated?</p>
               <p>3 Conſider, that the command of Chriſt is that all his publick worſhip muſt be done decently and in order, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. and ſeeing he doth require that the meaneſt circumſtances of his worſhip be done decently and in order, no doubt but he hath taken order that the main things of his publick worſhip ſhould be done de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:167973:57"/>
and in order, and that cannot be without ſome publick day be uniform. But if Chriſt Jeſus hath left the day of his publick worſhip arbitrary to his particular Churches, they will hardly agree upon a way of decency, eſpecially in reſpect of the ſolemnity of time, doubtleſſe they will appoint ſeveral dayes of the week as every Church ſhall think beſt for their own conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies; yea it may be that ſome particular Churches may grow ſo corrupt, that they may think one day in a month ſufficient, and others may think one day in two or three months ſufficient for Gods publick worſhip; and who can prevent ſuch diſorders a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> theſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if Jeſus Chriſt hath not eſtabliſhed a ſtanding day?</p>
               <p>There are ſome that profeſſe Chriſtianity that think that Jeſus Chriſt hath not eſtabliſhed a certain publick day in place of the ſeventh day; and therefore they do ſtill hold the Jewiſh Sabbath, together with the Lords day; As for example, The <hi>Melchites</hi> or <hi>Syrians</hi> (who are eſteemed for number to be the greateſt Sect of Chriſtians in the Orient) theſe do confound the day of Gods publick worſhip; for they, and the <hi>Maronites</hi> their neighbours, do obſerve the Jewiſh Sabbath, as ſolemnly as the Lords day. See <hi>Brerewood</hi> in his <hi>Inquiries,</hi> p. 129.</p>
               <p>And the <hi>Habbiſſines</hi> of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> who are another large Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of Chriſtians, they alſo do reverence the Jewiſh Sabbath equal to the Lords day. See <hi>Brerewood,</hi> p. 155. But bleſſed be God that hath given the Churches of <hi>Europe</hi> a cleerer under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of his will touching the day of his publick worſhip, and yet notwithſtanding, it is alſo much to be lamented, that ſome Chriſtians do not onely hold the ſeventh day to be aboliſhed, but alſo that Chriſt Jeſus hath not eſtabliſhed any publick day in the place of the old.</p>
               <p>But let me reaſon a little further, Can any man that is well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the order of the Commandements of the firſt Table, think that Chriſt (who bleſſed the ſeventh day with ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Ordinances for the good of faln man, and that ſanctified that day for the exerciſe of the ſaid Ordinances) ſhould now obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turate that Commandement, and ſanctifie no day at all for the exerciſe of his ſaid Ordinances? Can any man think that Chriſt ſhould now after his death, be ſo far unlike to his firſt pattern? Surely me thinks none ſhould be ſo inconſiderate. The holy Reſt of the ſeventh day as it was a typical ſign, ſo I
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:167973:58"/>
grant it to be aboliſhed, but not without any other in the place of it, but by way of exchange for the next day; And this the bleſſed Martyr <hi>Stephen</hi> doth explain to be the truth; for when he was accuſed for affirming that Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> ſhould deſtroy the holy place, and change the Cuſtomes that <hi>Moſes</hi> had delivered<note place="margin">Act 6. 14.</note> unto them, <hi>Act.</hi> 6. 14. his falſe witneſſes did affirm this word Change againſt <hi>Stephen,</hi> as if it had been an odious herefie to ſay ſo; but how doth <hi>Stephen</hi> anſwer to this Accuſation? Doth he deny it? No, he doth acknowledge it to be a truth in it ſelf, and therefore in his Oration to the High <hi>Synedrion,</hi> he doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm this to be a truth, by ſaying thus to them; <hi>Solomon built him a houſe, Howbeit the moſt High dwelleth not in Temples made with hands, as ſaith the Prophet</hi> (in <hi>Eſ. 66. 1.) What houſe will ye build for me, ſaith the Lord, or what place is it that I ſhould reſt in, Hath not my hand made all theſe things?</hi> Act. 7. 47. to 50. with theſe words <hi>Stephen</hi> doth<note place="margin">Act. 7. 47.</note> conclude his Oration. In theſe words he doth reprove the High <hi>Synedrion,</hi> becauſe of their obſtinate oppoſing the former Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; for his Doctrine tended to prove that God would not reſt locally in a Temple made with mans hands, and ſo conſequently, not in any other outward ſigns, implying, that God would onely reſt in Chriſt the true Temple, whom they had ſlain.</p>

               <p>Then he appeared unto two of his Diſciples as they went from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to <hi>Emaus,</hi> Luke 24. and he proved his Reſurrection to them from the Scriptures, and opened their underſtandings to underſtand what he ſaid; and this he did to draw them back again to the reſt of the Diſciples, partly that they might teſtifie the certainty of his Reſurrection, and partly that they might not be abſent from the Aſſembly when he ſhould come unto them, to inſtruct them further concerning his Death and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection.

               <p>I conclude therefore, that the ſame wonderfull providence that did order the Reſurrection of Chriſt to fall out upon the firſt day of the week, did order the day of Penticoſt to fall out at this time on the firſt day of the week.</p>

                     <hi>Reaſon</hi> 4.</note> hath ordained his Reſurrection-day for the day of his publick Worſhip in the place of the ſeventh day, is this, namely becauſe the Apoſtle did cauſe the Chriſtian Churches of <hi>Corinth</hi> to aſſemble together on this firſt day of the week, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 1, 2.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 16. 1, 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> did not now by this Epiſtle firſt begin to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point this Church to meet together every firſt day of the week; for he ſaith, <hi>

               <p>Hence it is evident, that the firſt day of the week, when Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians met together, (or as the Apoſtles phraſe is, when they are met, namely, according to their uſual and conſtant cuſtome) to worſhip God, then he did exhort them to lay aſide ſomething for the poor, for that day was a good day for their ſouls, and therefore that ſeaſon was a good ſeaſon to lay aſide ſomething for the poor Saints that were at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>

(as ſome would have the Text to ſpeak) doubtleſſe therefore they did lay aſide ſomething, either every firſt day of the week (or at leaſt uſually) when they were met together for the exerciſe of Gods worſhip, and in ſo doing, their zeal was exemplary to provoke them of <hi>Macedonia</hi> to imitate their example; and this is the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be beleeved, becauſe the Apoſtle doth ſtill exhort them to perform that duty, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 10, 11, 12.</p>
               <p>I conclude therefore, that though the word <hi>Every</hi> be not fully expreſſed in the Greek Text, yet that it muſt neceſſarily be underſtood, and therefore the <hi>Geneva</hi> Tranſlation that puts it in, is to be juſtified, becauſe it is according to the true ſenſe of the place.</p>
               <p>2 Touching this phraſe, <hi>Let every one of you lay by him in ſtore,</hi> I dare not affirm that this is meant of laying up by the Deacons Collection, but I rather think it was done by ſeparating ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by way of Vow for the uſe of the ſaid poor in every ones own hand, (which was as ſure a courſe, as if it had been put into the Box of the poor) for in this phraſe [<hi>Let every one of you lay by him in ſtore.</hi>] The Apoſtle doth <hi>Thalmudize,</hi> as relating therein to a certain cuſtome of the Jews in vowing ſomething to the poor; for the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors ſay, That Alms is comprehended in the general of Vows; and therefore he that ſaith thus, Lo this Shekel (or this Shilling) is an Alms, he is bound to give it to the poor out of hand; But if there be no poor preſent, he is bound to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate it, and to lay it Up till he find ſome poor.

the week: And the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors do adde this to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſpeech, <hi>That if a man had purpoſed</hi> (to give ſuch a quantity to the poor) <hi>but in his heart onely, he was bound to pay it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3 Hence it is evident, That the firſt day of the week, was by Chriſts Inſtitution the day of publick Worſhip in place of the ſeventh day, or elſe the Apoſtle would never have given direction to the Churches to ſeparate ſomething for the poor when they were met together on that day, for the Apoſtle doth profeſſe that in ſuch matters he ordained nothing in the Church, but what he received from the Lord, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 23.

dayes of Chriſt, becauſe it is not poſſible for all Peoples, and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to come to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> from month to month, and from Sabbath to Sabbath, to worſhip before the Lord there.</p>

               <p>An eighth Reaſon that doth much perſwade me that Chriſt hath<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſon</hi> 8.</note> ordained his Reſurrection-day, for the day of his publick wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in the place of the ſeventh day, is taken from the Myſtical number Eight; for the day of Chriſts Reſurrection in a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued reckoning of dayes, is the Eighth day; For he reſted all the ſeventh day in his Grave; and the next day being the Eighth day in order of dayes, he aroſe as an abſolute Conqueror, and the Myſtical number of Eight is a day of perfection in the Law, and therefore a fit type of the perfection of Chriſt by his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection on the Eighth day.</p>
               <p>1 No creature by the Levitical Law was allowable for ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. Lev. 22. 27. Exod. 22. 30.</note> untill it was eight dayes old, <hi>Lev.</hi> 22. 27. <hi>Exod.</hi> 22. 30.</p>
               <p>I cannot but wonder why the Lord did refuſe it as ſeven dayes old, ſeeing the ſeventh day was the day of Gods perfect reſt from all his works, for then he reſted in Chriſt that had made all perfect again after <hi>Adams</hi> fall by his Propitiatory Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Attonement.</p>
               <p>But when I conſider again that his Propitiatory Sacrifice was not evident to be perfect untill he roſe again from the dead, as the Lord and alone Conqueror of Satans Head-plot on the firſt day of the week, which day is alſo called the Eighth day by <hi>John,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 20. 26.</note> 
                  <hi>Joh.</hi> 20. 26.</p>
               <p>I ſay by this conſideration, my wondring is ſtaid, and I do rather wonder at Gods wiſe Providence that would not accept any young beaſt as a perfect beaſt for Sacrifice untill the eighth day, doubtleſſe it was in relation to the manifeſtation of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Chriſt his Sacrifice by his Reſurrection on the eighth day. For though the number ſeven be a perfect number in ſome reſpects, yet in other reſpects, the number eight is a more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect number.</p>
               <p>The Youngling muſt continue under the Dam ſeven dayes; during which ſpace of time the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors did call it <hi>Lacking Time,</hi> becauſe in that ſpace it was not perfect for Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:167973:64"/>
                  <hi>Although the Sabbath had paſſed over the head of it;</hi> But on the eighth day it was accounted perfect, and then, and not till then, it was accepted in Sacrifice. Therefore in the caſe of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices of Attonement the number ſeven was not ſo perfect as the number eighth; And what can this degree of perfection on the eighth day reſemble fitter than the manifeſtation of the perfection of Chriſts propitiatory Sacrifice by his Reſurrection on the eighth day: And truly, if he had not riſen from death to life the next day after the ſeventh day, his Sacrifice of Attonement by his death had been loſt and vain, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 17. And anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to the ſaid eighth day, <hi>John</hi> doth call the day of Chriſt his Reſurrection, the eighth day, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20. 26. The Providence of God ſo guiding his Pen, as pointing out unto us backward, to the perfection of the myſtical number eight in <hi>Moſes</hi> Law.</p>
               <p>My ſecond Reaſon why the number eight did typiſie the day<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſon</hi> 2.</note> of Chriſts Reſurrection, as more eminent than the ſeventh day, is taken from the Law of Circumciſion which was ſo ſtrictly tied to the eighth day, that though the eighth day did fall out upon the Sabbath day, yet they muſt prefer the doing of the act of Circumciſion, becauſe it was the eighth day, rather than the act of reſt, becauſe it was the ſeventh day, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7. 22. And the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> Doctors do affirm that Circumciſion in the time thereof<note place="margin">Joh. 7. 22.</note> drives away the Sabbath; that is to ſay, A man muſt omit to keep the reſt of the Holy Sabbath to circumciſe his child on the eighth day; if the Sabbath be the eighth day, ſeven dayes together the young Infant was in his blood of uncleanneſſe, but on the eighth day it muſt be circumciſed for the full cleanſing of it from all the pollution that did accompany it in the birth.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Rab. Menachem</hi> on <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. ſaith, Circumciſion was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore done on the eigth day, that the Sabbath might paſſe over it, for there is no eighth day without a Sabbath; and then as ſoon as it was circumciſed, it was accounted as a new creature, as if it were riſen again from death to life, and this did typifie our firſt reſurrection from the death of ſin, to the life of grace, by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of Chriſta Reſurrection, whoſe Reſurrection-day is called the eighth day, as I have ere-while noted from <hi>Joh.</hi> 20. 26.</p>

               </p>
               <p>And why was this eighth day made more eminent than all the other ſeven dayes? but to type out unto us the eminency of the Reſurrection-day of Chriſt above the ſeventh day for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of Gods publick worſhip to the worlds end; and the New Teſtament doth tell us of a great number of Chriſtians that were gathered into a great Church Aſſembly on this day at <hi>Jeruſalem Act.</hi> 2. 41. And this great Aſſembly was from divers parts, and quarters of the world, for many of the diſperſed Jewes that did beleeve, reſorted to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> from remote Countries at Feſtival times, and many that were converted to the faith did there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, untill they were diſperſed again at the death of <hi>Stephen,</hi> which diſperſion God turned to the further enlargement of his
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:167973:65"/>
Church for many of theſe diſperſed Diſciples preached the Goſpel in ſundry parts of the world where they travelled, and by that means a multitude, both of Jews and Heathens, became Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and theſe Chriſtians, in time made many Chriſtian Church-Aſſemblies, and they all uſed to meet together on the firſt day of the week, which was the next day after the ſeventh, and ſo it was the eighth day, which was typified by the eighth and laſt day of the Feaſt of Tabernacles.</p>
               <p>A ſixth Reaſon is borrowed from the Jubilee Yeer which by<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſon</hi> 6.</note> Gods ſpecial Providence was ordained to be in the eighth yeer after the ſeventh ſeven, and this ſabbatical yeer was ordained to be a greater Sabbath than the ſeventh ſeven, becauſe it was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to give a more full deliverance to Gods people than the ſeventh ſeven, <hi>Lev.</hi> 25. 4, 8, 20.<note place="margin">Lev. 25. 4.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The ſeventh ſeven was the forty and ninth yeer, and the next yeer after the ſeventh ſeven was the eighth yeer, and it was alſo the fiftieth yeer, or the Jubilee yeer.</p>
               <p>And both theſe Sabbatical yeers thus ſucceeding each other do moſt lively point out unto us, how the Lords Reſurrection-day (by which we have a full J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Three things are remarkable touching the number Eight.

                     <item>1 That the number Eight was myſtical as well as the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Seven.</item>

               </p>
               <p>Now ſeeing theſe things have been made cleer, and cannot be denied, how can it be denied, but that the number eight muſt needs have relation not onely to the Reſurrection of Chriſt on the eighth day (that is to ſay on the next day after the ſeventh day) but alſo that the ſaid day muſt be eſtabliſhed as a Sabbatical day among Chriſtians in the New Teſtament in the place of the ſeventh day?</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Propounding ſome Reaſons why the Apoſtles did allow of the Jewiſh Sabbath, or ſeventh day, in their Synagogues, for a time after it was aboliſhed by the death of Chriſt, as well as of the Lords Day in Chriſtian Churches.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe Apoſtles knew well enough that Chriſt had ordained his Reſurrection-day as the day of his publick Worſhip, in place of the ſeventh day, and therefore in that reſpect they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed all Chriſtian Churches to obſerve that day for Gods publick Worſhip, and yet notwithſtanding they ſtill reſorted to Gods publick Worſhip on the ſeventh day in the <hi>Jews</hi> Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues, for a certain ſpace of years after the death of Chriſt; I ſay, for ſome ſpace of time the Apoſtles did allow by way of permiſſion the uſe of the Sabbath, or ſeventh day, yea they did allow of the uſe of Sacrifices alſo in the Temple for a time, for they knew that as long as Chriſt was willing to ſuffer the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to ſtand undeſtroyed, that he was willing to ſuffer and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the uſe of Sacrifices and Sabbaths, and therefore for the weakneſſe ſake of many beleeving <hi>Jews,</hi> that did as yet remain in their old Synagogues, the Apoſtles did ſee it convenient to allow of the uſe of the ſeventh day for Gods publick Worſhip in their Synagogues, according to their ancient known cuſtom; yea moreover the Apoſtles did ſee it convenient to allow of the uſe of Circumciſion, and of all the other Cuſtoms of <hi>Moſes</hi> alſo for a time, for the weakneſſe ſake of many ten thouſand <hi>Iews</hi> that did beleeve in Chriſt, becauſe that many of theſe beleeving <hi>Iews</hi> did ſtill continue to be zealous aſſertors of the cuſtoms of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, <hi>Act.</hi> 21. 20. for many of theſe beleeving <hi>Iews</hi> were<note place="margin">Acts 21. 20</note> not only eminent for faith in Chriſt, but alſo they were eminent for zeal in <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, as we may ſee in the example of <hi>Ananias</hi> that opened <hi>Pauls</hi> eyes; It is recorded of him, that he was a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man, as pertaining to the Law, <hi>Act.</hi> 22. 12, and it is alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded, that there were divers other <hi>Iews</hi> that did beleeve in Chriſt, and yet they ſtill continued zealous not only for Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, but alſo for all the other cuſtoms of <hi>Moſes,</hi> Act. 15. 5.<note place="margin">Act. 15. 5. 24</note>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:167973:67"/>
and it was for the ſake of theſe beleeving <hi>Iews</hi> that as yet remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in Synagogues, that the Apoſtles did by way of permiſſion allow of the uſe of the Sabbath day in their Synagogues till a convenient time of Reformation.</p>
               <p>And out of this conſideration it was that the Apoſtles in their Decrees at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> did not abſolutely forbid the uſe of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. and out of this conſideration it was, that <hi>Paul</hi> took liberty to Circumciſe <hi>Timothy,</hi> that ſo he might there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by win the affection of the ſaid Synagogues where ſome belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>Iews</hi> were, to his perſon and Miniſtry, <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 3.<note place="margin">Acts 16. 3</note>
               </p>
               <p>Yea a long ſpace after the death of Chriſt, he did by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Apoſtle <hi>Iames</hi> take upon him to be a Conſort with four men, that took upon them a <hi>Levitical</hi> vow, namely, the <hi>Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites</hi> Vow; and <hi>Paul</hi> did well-nigh obſerve all the days of Purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation according to the cuſtom of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law; and he was alſo ready prepared to pay his part and ſhare of their Sacrifice to be<note place="margin">See <hi>Ainſw.</hi> in Numb. 6, 18</note> offered in the Temple, had not the Malignant <hi>Iews</hi> hindered him, by apprehending his Perſon, in a ſudden rage againſt him for pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luting the holy Temple, as they ſurmiſed, <hi>Act.</hi> 21. 24.

                  <note place="margin">Col. 2. 18<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 20</note> namely, of that precious liberty which Chriſt by his Death hath purchaſed for you, from the bondage of <hi>Moſes</hi> ceremonies, v. 18. and then he paſſeth his ſentence againſt the Authors of their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance, ſaying, <hi>They are but ſelf-willed in humbleneſſe,</hi> &amp;c. and then in ve. 20. the Apoſtles conclude thus, <hi>If ye be dead with Chriſt from the decrees of the world</hi> (if you beleeve that Chriſt by his death hath ended decrees) <hi>why as though yee lived in the world</hi> (namely in the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of <hi>Moſes</hi> ceremonies, which were compoſed but of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, and in that reſpect the Sanctuary is called a worldly Sanctuary, <hi>Heb. 9. 1.) Follow yee decrees, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That which I aym at by this diſcourſe is this, namely, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that there were ſome beleeving <hi>Jews</hi> in the Church of <hi>Coloſſe</hi> that did earneſtly contend (not only for the obſervation of <hi>Moſes</hi> ceremonies in general, but alſo that did in particular contend) for the obſervation of the Jewiſh Sabbath, as the only commanded day of Gods publick Worſhip in Chriſtian Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; and hence I infer, that theſe beleeving <hi>Jews</hi> needed not to have contended ſo earneſtly for the obſervation of the Jewiſh Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, if the Apoſtles had not laid the obſervation of it aſide, and required Chriſtian Churches to obſerve the Lords Day for their Chriſtian aſſemblies, in the place of the ſeventh day.</p>
               <p>Obj. 2. <hi>I conceive theſe beleeving</hi> Jews <hi>did not contend for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the Jewiſh Sabbath, as you think, but for the obſervation of the other Feſtival Sabbaths; againſt which only the Apoſtle doth ſpeak.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. If you will grant, That the Apoſtle doth exhort the Church of <hi>Coloſſe</hi> not to ſubmit their Conſciences to the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of their Feſtival Sabbaths, then much more doth he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort them not to ſubmit their Conſciences to the obſervation of
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:167973:71"/>
their weekly Sabbaths, or ſeventh day; for the weekly Sabbath was a typical ſign as well as their other Feſtival Sabbaths, and therefore the death of Chriſt doth aboliſh them all alike.</p>
               <p>2 And more particularly I anſwer, That <hi>Pauls</hi> meaning by the word Sabbaths, in <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 16. doth not (as I conceive) point out<note place="margin">Col. 2. 16</note> any other Sabbath but the ſeventh day only; for <hi>Paul</hi> doth enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merate all the ſeveral ſorts of their Holy-days under theſe three ſeveral expreſſions; Firſt, ſaith he, <hi>Let no man judge you in reſpect of a Holy-day;</hi> Secondly, <hi>Or of the New Moon;</hi> Thirdly; <hi>Or of the Sabbaths.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1 Under the term Holy-day the Apoſtle doth comprehend their three yearly Holy-day Feaſts; for there are no other ſolemn commanded Holy-days in <hi>Moſes,</hi> except the New Moon, and the ordinary Sabbath days, and theſe are not included in the term Holy-day, becauſe they are diſtinguiſhed, and ſorted out from them by other diſtinct terms; neither doth the Apoſtle comprehend any human Holy-days in this number, ſuch as were ſometimes commanded by their <hi>Sanedrim</hi> (upon ſome ſpecial occaſions) as the days of <hi>Purim</hi> were, <hi>Eſt.</hi> 9. and as the day of Dedication was, <hi>Job.</hi> 10. 22. for theſe temporary Holy-days muſt<note place="margin">Joh. 10. 22</note> not be Co-partners with the ſaid yearly ſtanding Holy-days of <hi>Moſes;</hi> neither do I think that the Apoſtle doth now forbid the obſervation of ſuch occaſional temporary Holy-days in Chriſtian Churches; but the Apoſtle doth out of all doubt dehort them from the obſervation of their three Feſtival Holy-days; therefore by the term <hi>Holy-day,</hi> which the Apoſtle diſtinguiſheth from the two other ſorts of Holy-days, namely from the New Moon, and from the Sabbath, he muſt needs mean no other but the ſaid three yearly Feſtival Holy-days.</p>
               <p n="2">2 By the New Moon the Apoſtle means the firſt day of every New Moon, which the <hi>Jews</hi> obſerved in all their Synagogues, as a conſtant Holy-day for the hearing of Gods Word preached in all the coſts of Iſrael, <hi>Numb. 28. 11. 2 King.</hi> 4. 23.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Therefore the term <hi>Sabbaths</hi> muſt needs mean their weekly Sabbaths, which ſome Chriſtian <hi>Jews</hi> that ſtill remained zealous for the Law, did labour tooth and nayl to perſwade the Church of <hi>Coloſſe</hi> to obſerve for the day of their publick Worſhip; but the Apoſtle told them, that all this Bill of Decrees Chriſt had wiped away by his death, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 14.<note place="margin">Col. 2. 14</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:167973:71"/>3 It is yet further evident that theſe three terms in <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 16. do fully comprehend all the Holy-dayes that are in <hi>Moſes,</hi> becauſe <hi>Moſes</hi> doth comprehend them all in three the like termes in <hi>Num. 10. 10. Ye ſhall ſound an Alarm, (1) In the day of your Glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Num. 10. 10.</note> And (2) <hi>In your Solemn Feaſts;</hi> And (3) <hi>In the beginning of your months.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Though theſe three termes are not placed in the ſame order that <hi>Paul</hi> doth his in <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 16. yet they muſt needs comprehend all the Ceremonial Sabbaths, or Holy-dayes of <hi>Moſes:</hi> For firſt, by the day of their Gladneſſe, <hi>Moſes</hi> doth mean ſuch a day of glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as he doth diſtinguiſh from their Solemn Feaſts, and from their New Moons; which diſtinction ought not to be ſleighted; And therefore <hi>Baal Hattarim</hi> underſtands it of the Sabbath day. And indeed no day hath the preheminence of gladneſſe to this day, for it was firſt ordained to be a day of reſt to God, becauſe he had eſtabliſhed <hi>Adams</hi> happineſſe, and the Government of the whole Creation on the Promiſed Seed, who had undertaken to break the Devils Head-plot, and therefore he reſted in the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and was refreſhed, and it was a typical ſign of faln mans reſting on the Mediator for his Redemption from Satans Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plot, and therefore it was the firſt great day of gladneſſe to faln <hi>Adam,</hi> and therefore as I have formerly noted, the ſeventh day is placed among the Feſtival Sabbaths in the firſt place, as the chiefeſt day of gladneſſe, <hi>Lev.</hi> 23. 3.<note place="margin">Lev. 23. 3.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And indeed no other day can be meant by the day of gladneſſe, but the Sabbath or ſeventh day, and the reaſon is plain, becauſe all the other Holy-dayes in <hi>Moſes</hi> are fully comprehended in the other two termes.</p>
               <p>4 <hi>Solomon</hi> in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 2. 4. doth expound the ſaid three termes,<note place="margin">2 Chron. 2. 4.</note> by ſhewing the ſolemnity of all the ſorts of Holy-dayes in the Temple-ſervice, for he built a Temple to the Lord, namely, <hi>To burn ſweet incenſe before Him, and for the continual Shew-bread, and for the Burnt-offerings of the morning and evening, (1) On the Sabbath dayes. (2) In the New Moons.</hi> And (3) <hi>In the Solemn Feaſts of the Lord.</hi> This is a perpetual thing for <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And moreover the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> Doctors ſay, That they did blow with the ſilver Trumpets in the Sanctuary, (1) Over the Burnt-offerings of the Sabbaths. (2) In the New Moons. And (3) in the Solemn Feaſts.</p>
               <p>By theſe two Scriptures compared together with <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 16.
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:167973:72"/>
and with <hi>Gal.</hi> 4 9, 10, 11. It is evident that all the ſolemn Holy-dayes in <hi>Moſes</hi> are comprehended under the ſaid three termes; And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by the term Sabbaths in <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 16. as it is diſtinguiſhed from the New Moon, and a Holy-day, muſt needs be meant the weekly Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths onely, which ſome Chriſtian Jews contended to have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in their Chriſtian Churches in oppoſition to the Lords day.</p>
               <p>Object. 3. <hi>It ſeems to me that our Saviour did not ordain his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection day in place of the ſeventh day, becauſe our Saviour in</hi> Mat. 24. 20.<note place="margin">Mat. 24. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>doth warn his Diſciples to pray (at the time of their deſtruction by the</hi> Romans) <hi>that their flight might not be, neither in the Winter, nor upon the Sabbath day: Now if Chriſt had aboliſhed the Sabbath by his death, as you affirm, then he would not have given this caution of praying that their flight might not be on the Sabbath day, ſo long after his death, for it was about forty yeers after his death ere the City was deſtroyed by the</hi> Romans.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Chriſt did not give this caution to his Diſciples in the nature of a Command, or forbidding, but in the nature of a diſ-allowing of the Jews ſuperſtitious opinion of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward reſt of the Sabbath, ſo long after his death: They might in that ſpace have been better taught and inſtructed, if they had not been enemies to the Goſpel of Chriſt, but becauſe they would not be inſtructed, therefore our Saviour told his Diſciples, that the <hi>Jews</hi> of <hi>Judea</hi> in general would hold ſuch a ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious opinion, both of the holineſſe of the Temple, and of the outward reſt of the Sabbath day, that it would be a grievous calamity to them if they were forced to flye for their lives upon the Sabbath day, more than upon any other day in the week: But yet this muſt be marked, that our Saviour ſpeaks this to his Diſciples, but as a Prophetical Hiſtorian, foretelling them what would be the common opinion of the Nation of the Jews in thoſe dayes, namely, that they would be infected with ſuch a ſuperſtitious opinion of the holineſſe of the outward reſt of the Sabbath, that they would neither ſtir hand or foot to break the outward reſt of the Sabbath by flight to ſave their lives. This caution of our Saviour to his Diſciples muſt needs be underſtood in this ſenſe, becauſe the whole frame of his ſpeech is fetched (by way of alluſion) to a former like ſad calamity, which fell upon them under <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> who did purpoſely moleſt them upon the Sabbath day, as alſo in the Winter time, and then
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:167973:72"/>
they ſuffered extreme miſeries by reaſon of their ſuperſtitious opinion of the outward reſt of the Sabbath day, which they might have prevented, if they had held it lawful at firſt, as they did at laſt, that in caſe of neceſſity they might either fight or flie for their lives upon the Sabbath day.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour in this his ſpeech to his Diſciples doth allude to the times of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> and therefore he doth mention the Winter as well as the Sabbath day, for <hi>Judas Maccabeus</hi> did cleanſe the Temple and the Altar in the Winter, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 22. and three yeers before it was polluted in the Winter, 1 <hi>Mac.</hi> 1. 54. And ſecondly, it was alſo polluted upon the Sabbath day, 1 <hi>Mac.</hi> 2. 38. and now it was a time of grievous calamity to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by way of alluſion to this calamitous time, our Saviour bad them pray. That their flight might neither be in the Winter, nor yet upon the Sabbath day, for then they would do as they had done, neither fight nor flye to ſave their lives. This their blind zeal our Saviour reproves, 1 <hi>Mac.</hi> 2, 34. 36. 38. 41. and 2 <hi>Mac.</hi> 6. 11.</p>
               <p>It follows therefore by good conſequence, that our Saviour did not now in ſadneſſe teach his Diſciples the continuance of the Sabbath ſo long after his death, no more than he taught them the continuance of the ſervice of the Temple, by calling the Temple <hi>The Holy Place,</hi> verſ. 15. But no man, I think, will ſay, that Chriſt did then eſteem the Temple to be the Holy Place, but he names it ſo <hi>Docaſtic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Jews</hi> of <hi>Judea</hi> in general would then eſteem it and call it the Holy place, and in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect alſo our Saviour doth call the <hi>Romans</hi> that ſhould enter into the Temple, <hi>The Abomination of Deſolation,</hi> juſt as <hi>Daniel</hi> had done, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 27. By this it is evident that Chriſt ſpake by alluſion to former times: But he knew well enough that the holineſſe of the Temple, as well as the typical Reſt of the Holy Sabbath, were fully ended by his death.</p>
               <p>I grant, that the Temple was once truly called the Holy Temple, becauſe it was ordained to be a type of the holy humane nature of Chriſt wherein his God-head dwelt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 2: But yet this typical holineſſe of the Temple muſt needs have an end, as ſoon as the Holy of Holies did but enter through the vail of his fleſh into heaven to appear before God for us, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 24. with <hi>Mat. 27. 50, 51. Heb.</hi> 9. 14. and the goodlineſſe alſo of the Temple muſt
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:167973:73"/>
have an end as ſoon as he that was greater than the Temple had finiſhed his Oblation, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 26. and by the like reaſon alſo the Sabbath, as it was a type of our reſting on the Sèed of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to break the Devils Head-plot, muſt end as ſoon as Chriſt had finiſhed his Sacrifice of Attonement.</p>
               <p>I will therefore conclude my anſwer to this Objection, That Chriſt by this ſpeech of his to his Diſciples did but tell them what would be the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon opinion of the Nation of the <hi>Jews</hi> at the time of the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as I have already declared it; but he intended no more to teach them the continuance of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, than the continuance of the Holineſſe of the Temple; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did he by this Caution to his Diſciples intend to prefer the Sabbath above the Lords day, no more than he intended to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Winter above the Summer, of all which things he ſpake by way of caution to his Diſciples what would be the common opinion of the <hi>Jews</hi> at the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Object. 4. <hi>If Chriſt had ordained his Reſurrection-day as the day of his publick Worſhip in place of the Sabbath or ſeventh day, then me thinks the Apoſtles in their Writings ſhould have recorded it, with the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of it, namely, the time when, and how he did ordain it; if this had been done, the matter had been out of queſtion to all men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Wiſdome of God did not ſee it good to make all his Ordinances cleer to all men at the firſt fight; when our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour was here upon the earth, he did oftentimes open his mouth in Parables, that they which ſee not might not perceive, and that his beſt ſervants might dig for his hidden Treaſures: But I may ſay alſo it is not recorded that Chriſt did inſtruct any of his Apoſtles of the time when, nor of the manner how he did firſt ordain <hi>John</hi> to baptiſe, but becauſe all men generally held <hi>John</hi> to be a Prophet, therefore they concluded that he had received ſome authority from heaven to baptiſe ſubjects for Chriſt, againſt he came into his Kingdome, which he proclamed to be at hand; and by the like authority, we may conclude that the Apoſtles did command the obſervation of the Lords day for Gods publick Worſhip in the place of the ſeventh day, becauſe it was in frequent uſe in their dayes, as I have proved, and they being Prophets, had ſpecial direction from Chriſt the Lord of the Sabbath ſo to direct his Churches, which directions in all probability they received from him at his firſt comming
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:167973:73"/>
to their Aſſembly in the evening of his Reſurrection-day, or elſe in the evening of his ſecond coming to their Aſſembly, on that day ſeven-night, <hi>Joh.</hi> 19. 20. 26. for then he opened their underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to underſtand ſuch Scriptures as he alleged concerning his<note place="margin">Joh. 19. 20, 26.</note> Death and Reſurrection, <hi>Luke</hi> 23. 54. 47. and then alſo he gave them a new Commiſſion to preach the Doctrine of the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſins in his name, <hi>Joh,</hi> 20. 21, 22, 23. and then he gave Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements unto them, and ſpake of ſuch things as appertained to the Kingdome of God, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 2, 3. doubtleſſe therefore he did then inſtruct them concerning the day of his publick worſhip wherein <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>they muſt preach forgiveneſs of ſins in his name to all the world; and this Commiſſion he did again renew unto them before his aſcenſion, ſaying, <hi>Go and teach all Nations, baptizing them in the Name of the Father, Son, and holy Ghoſt, teaching them to obſerve all things whatſoever I have commanded you, and Io I am with you alwayes to the end of the world.</hi> Whatſoever therefore the Apoſtles com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Chriſtian Churches to obſerve, they did it by vertue of Chriſts former command; and therefore <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of the Lord that which I have delivered unto you,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 23. The Commandements therefore which the Apoſtles gave unto the Chriſtian Churches, they were the Commandements of Chriſt, among which Commandements, the obſervation of the Lords day muſt needs be one in place of the Sabbath, which was fully aboliſhed by the death of Chriſt.</p>

And this Feaſt I conceive was a Wedding Feaſt, though I alſo beleeve that the<note place="margin">It is unlawfull to begin a Mariage upon the Sabbath day. Lev. 23 8.</note> new maried parties were maried before this day, &amp; not on this day, for the <hi>Jews</hi> held it utterly unlawful to begin their Mariage upon the Sabbath day. See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 23. 8. But yet they held it lawful to keep a Wedding Feaſt upon the Sabbath day, and the reaſon is plain, becauſe they held it to be a lawfull cuſtome to keep a Wedding Feaſt for ſeven dayes together, of which number the Sabbath day muſt needs be one, <hi>Judg. 14. 10, 12. Gen.</hi> 29. 27, 28. And this is a common rule among the <hi>Jews, That whoſoever marieth a Maid, he ſhall rejoyce with her ſeven dayes, not doing any work, but eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, drinking, and making merry.</hi> See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Gen.</hi> 29. 27.</p>
               <p>And none could keep ſuch a Feaſt of many perſons in the cold Winter without the uſe of a fire to make their food comfortable to nature, according to the nature of a Feaſt. And it is further to be noted, that whiles our Saviour was preſent at this Feaſt, he found no fault with the act of Feaſting, but onely with ſome
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:167973:74"/>
corrupt circumſtances which did accompany this Feaſt. 1 He found fault with ſome of the gueſts, becauſe they choſe out the uppermoſt ſeats. 2 He ſeemed to reprove the Governour of the Feaſt, becauſe he invited his rich friends onely, verſ. 12. But Chriſt told him it had been more ſuitable to the Sabbath day if he had invited the poor to his Feaſt: And yet I beleeve it was not ſinfull to bid the rich; for if it had been ſinfull, Chriſt would ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have declined the invitation, or elſe he would have born witneſſe againſt it a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> a ſinful practiſe; but he did neither of theſe, therefore it was not ſinful to invite the rich to a Feaſt upon the Sabbath day, where the Feaſt muſt laſt ſeven dayes together.</p>
               <p n="2">2 I anſwer, That it was as lawfull for the <hi>Jews</hi> to kindle a fire upon the Sabbath day to prepare warm food for infirm and weak ſtomacks (which are almoſt in every family) as it was to do any other work of mercy: And it was lawfull to do works of mercy upon the Sabbath dayes, as it is evident by our Saviours often ſhewing of compaſſion to weak and ſickly perſons upon the Sabbath day.</p>

Hence I infer, that ſeeing Chriſt Jeſus hath told us that he doth prefer mercy before Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, no queſtion but he allowed the <hi>Jews</hi> to kindle a fire for works of mercy, as well as for the uſe of Sacrifices, on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, and therefore out of doubt they might kindle a fire on the Sabbath day to prepare neceſſary food for ſuch as are infirm of nature.

               <p>I conclude therefore, by comparing the work of the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle in <hi>Exod.</hi> 31. with the work of the Tabernacle, as it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated in <hi>Exod.</hi> 35. that the only reaſon why they might not kindle a fire in their Habitations on the Sabbath Day was, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain them from their eager deſire, from their raſh or ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious zeal to proſecute the work of the Tabernacle, which was commanded to be done with ſuch careful diligence for the place of Gods reſidence among them; the Lord doth prefix a prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to reſtrain them from kindling any fire for that work, and to prevent their raſh and heady zeal a threatning is annexed; <hi>W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The promiſe in <hi>Eſ.</hi> 58. 13. (to ſuch as make conſcience of ſanctifying the Sabbath in the inward man) I confeſſe, is made to that Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath of Sabbatiſm called the day of Attonement, but yet this day of Attonement muſt be conſidered as it was a Sabbath of equal reſpect in regard of the ſanctified time of Gods worſhip to the ſeventh day, and therefore that which is unlawfull to be done in the one, is unlawfull to be done in the other alſo, both in reſpect of the outward, and alſo in reſpect of the inward man.</p>
               <p>Queſt. 7. <hi>Did not the Jews hold it lawfull to do works of mercy and works of preſent neceſſity on the Sabbath day?</hi>

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. In the dayes of our Saviour, ſome of the Jews were ſo ſupeſtitious of the outward reſt of the Sabbath, that they were often offended with our Saviour, becauſe he did works of mercy, and works of neceſſity on the Sabbath day; but it was not ſo with the Jews from elder times; <hi>Maymony</hi> ſaith, <hi>If a Thief dig thorow a houſe upon the Sabbath day, it is free for any to kill him with any death they can put him to.</hi> See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Exod.</hi> 22. 2. This they allowed<note place="margin">Exod. 22. 2.</note> as a caſe of preſent neceſſity, it could not be deferred, as a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate may defer the putting off a Malefactor to death, untill any one of the ſix dayes, becauſe the Magiſtrate hath the Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor in ſafe cuſtody in ſome ſure priſon; and therefore they ſay, It is not lawfull to put a Malefactor to death on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, becauſe it is written that no fire ſhall be kindled upon the Sabbath day, <hi>Exod.</hi> 35. 3. namely not for the uſe of any mans particular Calling (as I have already opened this Text) therefore no fire may be kindled upon the Sabbath day for the execution of a Malefactor, for that was but the work of the Magiſtrates ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil<note place="margin">See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in Exod. 35. 3.</note> Calling. See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Exod.</hi> 18. 22. and yet notwithſtanding they held it lawfull for the Magiſtrate to put a Malefactor to death upon a Feſtival Sabbath (as it appears by their practice in<note place="margin">Joh. 19. 31.</note> putting our Saviour to death on a Feſtival Sabbath, for they did not hold thoſe Sabbaths to be equal to the ſeventh day) but if a Thief came to ſteal on the Seventh day, and was taken in dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thorow an houſe, they held it lawful for a private man to kill him on the Sabbath day (though they did not hold it lawfull for a Magiſtrate to kill a Thief then) becauſe it was a caſe of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:167973:79"/>
neceſſity, for he might eſcape unleſſe he were killed at that inſtant.</p>
               <p>And truly Chriſtians may do as much as this on the Lords day, and no more, without ſin.</p>
               <p>2 Our Saviour confuted the Jews ſuperſtitious conceit of the outward reſt of the Sabbath, by examples from their own practice; for when they took offence at his miraculous cures upon the Sabbath day, he asked them why they held it lawful to untie their Cattle, and lead them to the water upon the Sabbath day, and ſo to give them Hay and Provender, and to pull a Sheep out of the pit upon the Sabbath day; and therefore ſaid he, Why may not I ſhew mercy to a Daughter of <hi>Abraham</hi> that is in miſery upon the Sabbath day? And ſeeing they held it lawfull for <hi>Abia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thar</hi> to give the Shew-bread to hungry <hi>David,</hi> he asked them, Why it was not as lawful for his hungry Diſciples to pluck ears of corn and to rub them, and prepare them for the ſuſtenance of their preſent hunger upon the Sabbath day; and after Chriſt had cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Criple, he bad him take up his bed and walk, to ſave it from ſpoyling, and from loſſe, upon the Sabbath day; and when he cured blind eyes upon the Sabbath day with clay tempered into a ſalve, he did it to warrant Chirurgeons, and Phyſitians, that they might lawfully temper their Potions and Plaſters upon the Sabbath day to cure the ſick and weak.</p>
               <p>By theſe, and ſuch like examples in the New Teſtament, our Saviour declared what liberty God gave unto the Jews, to do works of mercy, or of preſent neceſſity, upon the Sabbath day; and truly thoſe Chriſtians that will contend for more liberty than this upon the Lords day, do in effect deny, that the Lords day was ordained with any ſolemn ſanctity.</p>
               <p>3 Though the preſent Apoſtate Jews did malign our Savior for doing many works of mercy, and in preſent neceſſity, upon the Sabbath day; yet the ancient <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors, recorded by their later Doctors, held otherwiſe: They ſay, that the perill of life puts away the Sabbath, and therefore to a ſick perſon that is in danger of death, they do all things needfull for him upon the Sabbath day. See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 10. And though the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors do affirm that Circumciſion in the time thereof doth drive away the Sabbath, becauſe there was a neceſſity of doing it on the eighth day, (See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 12.) yet ſay the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:167973:79"/>
in caſe of ſickneſſe they do not circumciſe him that is ſick, untill he be well; (and again) they circumciſe none but children that are without ſickneſſe, for perill of life putteth away all. See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> on <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 13. And on the day of Attonement which was a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath of Sabbatiſm for ſtrict reſt, yet then they made ready pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of food for him that lead the Scape-Goat into the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe, yea though that Sabbath was alſo an exceeding ſtrict Faſting-day; yet then at the end of every mile they ſaid unto him that lead the Scape-Goat, <hi>Lo here is meat, and here is water, and if his ſtrength failed him, and if he had need to eat, he might eat.</hi> See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 16. 21. The <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors alſo ſay, That if the High Prieſt were an old man, or ſickly, he might have the water made warm, wherein he waſhed his body on that ſtrict Sabbath of Attonement, either by Irons made hot in the fire, or elſe by the mixture of ſome hot water with the cold. See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 16. 24. By theſe, and the like teſtimonies, we ſee that the ancient <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> Doctors held that the Sabbath was made for man in miſery, not onely for the curing of his ſick and ſinfull ſoul by thoſe bleſſed Ordinances wherewith God did at firſt bleſſe the ſeventh day, but even for the curing and comforting of his weak and ſickly body; and theſe are the chief ends for which the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath was ordained from the very firſt Inſtitution of it.</p>
               <p>And the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors were very careful to provide a remedy againſt immoderate toyl and labour to mens bodies in travelling to the publick Ordinances which were diſpenced every Sabbath day in their Synagogues: For by vertue of Gods Command, there was a neceſſity laid upon all the Jews to reſort to ſome holy Convocation in all their dwellings, <hi>Lev.</hi> 23. 3. namely, in all their<note place="margin">Lev. 23. 3.</note> Synagogues, which muſt be placed in the midſt of their dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings. Hence the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors knowing the Command of God for ſuch holy Convocations in all their dwellings; (and knowing the Command of God to reſt on the ſeventh day from all their works) did appoint a certain diſtance how far men might travel on the Sabbath day to the Synagogue, and they thought good to reſtrain it to an Engliſh mile, to prevent the labour of travel, and the wearineſſe of mens bodies which might unfit them for the reverend attention to Gods Ordinances; and from this limited ſpace, it is that we read of a Sabbath dayes journey, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 12. They did not ordain this Sabbath dayes<note place="margin">Acts 1. 12.</note>
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:167973:80"/>
journey for any Civil buſineſſes of mens particular Callings, but for the uſe of Religious duties, and for works of mercy on the Sabbath day.</p>
               <p>And this proportion of a mile they took from the example of Gods limits which he allowed to the Suburbs of their Cities, for the Suburbs of their Cities might not exceed two thouſand Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits by meaſure, <hi>Num.</hi> 35. 5. The like diſtance God appointed between the Camp of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and the Ark of the Lords Covenant when they paſſed over the River <hi>Jordan,</hi> Joſ. 3. 4. From theſe eminent examples the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors ordained that no Tent ſhould be pitched in the Wilderneſſe, nor no Houſe in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> above two thouſand Cubits from their Synagogue-aſſemblies, which is an Engliſh mile; and this diſtance they uſually called A Sabbath dayes journey.</p>
               <p>And this order was a provident proviſion both for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation of the Word (for by ſuch ſhort diſtances from their Synagogues they muſt have many Synagogues) and in order to a work of Mercy to their bodies, that they might not weary their bodies by long travel, when they came unto Gods preſence to be partakers of his holy Ordinances; but in caſes of neceſſity (they not withſtanding this reſtraint to a mile) when the means of Grace did by any occaſion fail in any of their Synagogues at home, then they held it without ſcruple lawful to go further, as we may ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e by the liberty that the People took in the days of Chriſt, for then they did leave their Synagogues to follow his preaching from place to place; and if Chriſt had held their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice to be unlawful, doubtleſſe he would have reproved them, and bid them keep their own Synagogues, and not follow him from place to place as they did; and for the attaining of ſuch excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent means of Grace, the people alſo held it lawful to leave their own Synagogues, and to break the outward reſt of the Sabbath by longer Journies, and greater Bodily labour; and ſo we ſee that the Prieſts in the Law did break the outward reſt of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath by their laborious killing and dreſſing of Sacrifices, and yet they were blameleſſe, <hi>Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>. 12. 5. 1 Chro.</hi> 23. 31. and ſo alſo for their Bodily food, they did kindle Fires to Roſt and Boyl the portion of their Sacrifices <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>it for their ſtomacks every Sabbath Day; for their portions muſt be eaten in the ſame day in which the Sacrifice was offered, nothing thereof muſt remain until the

morning; but in caſe any part of their portions did remain until the morning, it muſt be burnt, <hi>Levit. 7. 15. Exod.</hi> 12. 10.</p>
               <p>I conclude therefore, That the <hi>Jews</hi> had as much liberty in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects to do any thing on the Sabbath Day, tending to the good of their Souls, or to their Bodies, either in caſes of neceſſity or mercy, as Chriſtians have upon the Lords Day; but both ſorts have corrupt hearts alike, and have alike need to watch unto the ſanctified improvement of the whole day; and both ſorts have the ſame Adverſary the Devil to deal withall, and therefore both ſorts have need alike to keep a good watch over Satan, and over their own corrupt hearts, or elſe the ſpiritual efficacy of Gods Holy Ordinances will be loſt and vain, which is the only thing that the Devil deſires to effect, that he may rejoyce in the ruine of our Souls.</p>
               <p>O that Chriſtians therefore would ſubmit their Conſciences to the command of Chriſt, to keep the Lords Day as ſtrictly from outward works, and as holily in all Chriſtian duties, as ever the <hi>Jews</hi> did, or ought to have kept the Sabbath Day.</p>
               <p>And ſo Jehovah cauſe his face to ſhine upon every Soul that truly honours the ſanctified time of the Lords Day, and the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity of all publick and private holy duties.</p>
               <closer>Amen, Amen.</closer>
